Here I am working closely with my colleague ￭, Pascal Lamy ￭.
One of the tasks entrusted to us by our constituents is coming to the defence of the victims of discrimination ￭.
Therefore the Commission cannot accept ￭, and rejects ￭, Amendments Nos 12 and 13 of Mr F￭ ava ￭'￭ s report ￭.
B￭ earing in mind the next Lima Summit ￭, the attitude of President Chávez represents a serious challenge which must be carefully considered by the European Union and its Member States ￭.
The United Nations has a more urgent assign￭ ment here than in Iraq ￭.
Mr President ￭, thank you ￭, my time is up ￭.￭ We shall see whether it will be possible to commemor￭ ate S￭ reb￭ ren￭ ica in another way ￭, by giving it ￭, at the least ￭, the tribute of truth and an acknowledg￭ ement of the co￭ war￭ dice of Europe and the UN ￭.
Let us make real efforts ￭, within the framework of EU 2020 ￭, to bring about a comp￭ elling investment rail project which will be good for the individual citizen ￭, good for the environment and good for employment ￭.
The content of the document submitted by the Commission ￭, too ￭, has undergone a significant change compared to previous years ￭, and it points in the right direction ￭.
It will allow us to reach a goal which we all share ￭: the goal of preparing for enlargement of the Union with institutions which are able to cope with this difficult project ￭.
However ￭, Israel still holds po￭ ckets of Lebanese territory in the south and has not yet provided maps of where the land￭ mines are so that they can be cleared and ￭, as a result ￭, nine sh￭ ep￭ her￭ ds have been killed since the withdrawal ￭.
Joint resolution on Kosovo
The possibility of correc￭ ting situations of data transmission that may subsequently be judged to have been un￭ due has also been guaranteed ￭.
Does the Presidency have any plans to launch more initiatives in this area in future ￭?
It is wrong to refer to old Member States ￭, some of which – and I do not wish to single out France – deny even the existence of minorities ￭, and if they were to apply for accession to the European Union today ￭, they would be definitely turned down ￭.
You cannot define a substance as '￭ dangerous ￭' on the basis of its properties ￭, but only on the basis of its uses ￭.
In my view ￭, dialogue with third countries ￭, combined with measures aimed at development ￭, is the most important element here ￭. Indeed ￭, such measures involve immigrants as they send a large proportion of their income to their families and this constitutes a significant amount of aid for both the families and the countries themselves ￭.
However ￭, the problem our continent has today is that it is emerging from a serious crisis ￭, the characteristics of that being that we have extremely weak ￭, or even negative ￭, growth globally ￭.
Prince G￭ rig￭ or Pot￭ em￭ kin ￭, the favour￭ ite of Catherine the Great ￭, had conqu￭ ered the Cri￭ mea ￭.
Some people are calling for a ‘￭ yes ￭’ without any real conviction and sending confused and contradictory messages to their own voters ￭, seeking only to er￭ ode the current government of Spain ￭.
Let me add something about the problem at hand ￭, the one that really led to this debate here today in the first place ￭.
We will see to it that these objectives are reflected on the ground ￭, particularly in terms of the development of biofuels and of inland water￭ way transport ￭.
Yes ￭.
This European Parliament has always shown an interest in the problems of towns and cities ￭, both small and large ￭, and in 1999 ￭, I would remind you ￭, the Community UR￭ BAN initiative was maintained at the insist￭ ence of the European Parliament ￭.
In fact ￭, it is a constant source of alarm to me that so far we have failed in the course of this debate ￭, to convince the general public of the need for this kind of Europe ￭, and ￭, in particular ￭, we have failed to convey to them that the key to developing a global outlook is to make Europe strong ￭, and this strong Europe must make provisions ￭; not for everything ￭, but certainly for matters that lend added value to Europe ￭.
The best possible result could therefore be achieved if notification concerned only those projects that have obtained the necessary authorisations and permits or those for which a final investment decision has been taken ￭.
I have received two requests for the Commission to make statements ￭.
I voted in favour of Mr Bel￭ et ￭'￭ s report on public service broadcasting ￭.
It is not easy but it is essential and we are well placed because we have ￭, to a limited extent ￭, managed that ￭.
Perhaps our greatest disappointment is with regard to enlargement ￭.
For some time ￭, with the support of the European Parliament ￭, we have been endeav￭ ouring to improve the governance arrangements of the I￭ AS￭ CF tru￭ ste￭ es ￭, no￭ ting that they are an independent organisation ￭.
I think the previous Council had it absolutely right when they said they did not want it ￭.
In addition ￭, the list of communic￭ able diseases is now real and no longer only indicative ￭.
The next step will be the Joint Council of the Ministers of Finance and Social Affairs ￭, then the tri￭ partite conference ￭, then the European Council in Florence ￭.
I hope that the agreement with Mercosur ￭, which is on the point of being signed ￭, if things go ahead as planned ￭, will be added to those in force with Chile and with Mexico and that these two regions can benefit from more ambitious agreements ￭, the results of which will not be seen by the current Commission and Parliament ￭, but by our success￭ ors ￭.
If only that were true ￭.
On the question of visa facilitation ￭, we know that this is something that has been requested ￭.
. Mr President ￭, I should like to propose an oral amendment to insert a new paragraph 5￭ a ￭.
Mr President ￭, Commissioners ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, the general disappointment at the failure of the WTO negotiations in Cancún is evident ￭, and the Group of the European Liberal ￭, Democrat and Reform Party too is of the opinion that this negative outcome is a missed opportunity ￭.
The Europe of En￭ ligh￭ ten￭ ment ￭, of values ￭, of dignity ￭, lacks policy coherence ￭.
On the other hand ￭, it is important for the peace of mind of thousands of workers ￭, and compatible with the overall amount planned ￭, that the level of aid planned for this financial year for the social chapter for coal should be maintained ￭.
The next item is Question Time to the Council (￭ B ￭4 ￭-￭ 09￭ 01 ￭/￭ 97 ￭) ￭.
Trade relations between the European Union and Macao are important ￭.
We believe that that would provide the appropriate balance ￭.
For example ￭, Finland has almost 200 000 la￭ kes ￭, hundreds of thousands of other water￭ courses ￭, and one of the world ￭'￭ s most pollu￭ ted seas ￭.
The rapporteur for the Budget Committee ￭, Mr Colo￭ m i Naval ￭, added in point 37 of the supporting statement of his report what he calls a final note on the administrative expenditure ￭.
Mr Gor￭ o￭ sti￭ aga ￭, you are a disgr￭ ace to this Parliament ￭.
We have a general product safety law ￭, we have a to￭ y safety law but we need to step up enforcement and inspection regimes ￭.
Do the Commission ￭'￭ s priorities include setting a maximum selling price for certain basic foods ￭?
But the entire College of Commissioners ￭, including the President ￭, will not be confirmed until the treaty comes into force ￭.
Today we have an opportunity to narrow the gap between Islam and the West ￭, thanks to a country that has roots in both the history of Christianity and that of Islam ￭.
Parliament has been helping to ensure that positive steps towards intelligent debt management are taken ￭.
We believe that real progress on this will be of benefit to both our peoples ￭.
If it wants to resolve its serious economic and social problems ￭, the right thing for it must be a good relationship with all its neighbours ￭, both new and old ￭, and this it must be allowed to build up under wh￭ ich￭ ever President ￭, without empty promises ￭, ad￭ monit￭ ory finger ￭-￭ w￭ agging or un￭ conce￭ aled arm ￭-￭ tw￭ isting ￭.
The laws on dis￭ miss￭ al are very strict ￭, with the result that employers try to b￭ yp￭ ass these laws by recru￭ iting illegal workers ￭.
I would also add one comment on the other decisions that we have reached this morning ￭: if this house is not to de￭ generate into a large gy￭ mn￭ asi￭ um for building up our bic￭ ep￭ s ￭, because we spend more time voting on the do￭ tting of "￭ i ￭' s and crossing of "￭ t ￭' s than on political discussion . ￭. ￭.
In my view ￭, this directive goes in the right direction and does some justice to all the workers because it will bring many workers under full control that were hitherto excluded ￭.
This leads the Commission to continue to implement the reform programmes for the social security systems in the applicant countries ￭.
Let us go back to the root of the problem ￭.
Questions to the Council used to be held at 9 p ￭.￭ m ￭. ￭, or from 8 p ￭.￭ m ￭. to 10 p ￭.￭ m ￭. ￭, and for ten to fifteen years that worked perfectly ￭, until the Council decided it was ti￭ red in the ev￭ en￭ ings and had to leave ￭, so that Question Time was moved to the afternoon ￭, and since then ￭, Question Time has been cut back or moved ￭, always to make room for other items of business ￭.
Nevertheless ￭, if within a period of one year ￭, these international bodies do not achieve a common rule ￭, the Commission will be empowered to present a new proposal ￭, since we do not want to ignore our responsibilities ￭, stem￭ ming from our strong presence in the fishing grounds ￭.
Since 2002 the European Union has been end￭ owed with a Solidarity Fund that enables emergency financial assistance to be given to European regions hit by such natural disasters ￭.
That suggests ￭: '￭ Domestic violence against women is the main cause of death and in￭ validity among women between the ages of 16 and 44 ￭. ￭'
Mr President ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, over the years ￭, many of my fellow Members and I have become aware of the problem of abandoned children ￭, orph￭ ans and street children ￭.
Whether or not the decision on Turkey was for the greater good of the Union and Turkey ￭, only time will tell ￭.
The High Representative should step up the human rights dialogue with China and make it more action ￭-￭ oriented and effective ￭.
It is not for us to tell Azerbaijan ￭, Georgia or Armenia how to run their affairs ￭, but with the benefit of our experience we can reach out to a region that is looking to the EU for help ￭, inspiration and perhaps even leadership ￭.
All the Member States ￭, including those which are neutral ￭, should therefore participate in this common foreign and security policy ￭, including the defence dimension ￭, because that represents the great step forward ￭.
He has been held in the area ever since ￭.
Furthermore ￭, Parliament is aiming at the wrong main target ￭.
Regarding the proposal to review arrangements for the awar￭ ding of a European eco ￭-￭ label ￭, I would like to emphasize two points that I consider to be very positive initiatives ￭.
We must ensure that the origin￭ ators and copyright holders are also protected ￭.
The report is also honest ￭.
At present ￭, the networks of a number of Member States are still too isolated and ￭, consequently ￭, they are too dependent on imports from third countries ￭.
It will only back￭ fire on you when the EU starts to interfere ￭. ￭' However ￭, the impact is positive ￭.
Finally ￭, the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European legal area ￭, albeit partial and limited ￭, but it respon￭ ds to the real needs of an enormous number of European citizens who ￭, until now ￭, have been largely un￭ protected on becoming victims of crime outside their usual country of residence ￭.
I find this an excellent proposal ￭, and I think we should do it - not just in relation to the area discussed in the report ￭, but also in other areas ￭.
Solidarity and coherence are more than ever the key words of our European Union ￭.
Most of these conflicts have their origins in social antagon￭ isms of an ethnic and ￭/￭ or religious nature ￭.
As to the question of our assistance in Palestine ￭, we continue to provide to the Palestinian authority - and this is a policy that began because of the block put on the payment of tax revenues by Israel to the Palestinian authority - very carefully controlled and monitored assistance ￭, for instance to pay for doctors and nur￭ ses and for the ordinary infrastructure ￭.
I shall make an appr￭ ais￭ al of the basic amendments and ￭, at the same time ￭, reply to the main issues raised today ￭.
I believe that we have in this Chamber 6￭ 26 people who are free to express whatever view they wish ￭.
There may be other ￭, different ways of achieving them ￭. From my point of view it suff￭ ices that we should be attentive to public opinion in the various Member States ￭, which of course is expressed through their national Parliam￭ ents ￭.
One amendment that was tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ￭, and that was approved ￭, ins￭ ists on us sharing our expertise with the world ￭’￭ s poor countries where agriculture is so important ￭.
I supported this report by voting in favour because I believe that we need rules during the transitional period to ensure legal certainty and avoid conflicts and gaps in the law ￭.
I should appreciate your support for this amendment ￭.
In any event ￭, it will be difficult for the fight against illegal immigration to be carried out if there is no effective cooperation with the States of the European Union and in this regard ￭, we believe that the European Union must reconsider its relations with Libya ￭.
In Sweden ￭, we had a storm which meant that getting on for 50 000 households ￭, together of course with industry and small enterprises in the areas affected ￭, were without electricity for more than two months after this storm ￭, something that is completely unacceptable ￭.
The Roma question is a paradox￭ ical one for Europe in many sen￭ ses ￭.
Furthermore ￭, when managing their water resources ￭, our neighbours may adopt measures that affect Portuguese interests ￭, but there is nothing that we ￭, on the other hand ￭, can do in terms of our water resources that would directly affect Spanish interests ￭.
Of course ￭, economic progress in China continues ap￭ ace ￭, but that will soon meet limits if the process of economic development does not give rise to better conditions ￭.
Consequently ￭, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole ￭. We dis￭ approve ￭, however ￭, of its lack of emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity ￭.
In paragraph 48 ￭, he rightly calls for the study of varied economic policy scenarios to give a better understanding of how the economic situation is developing ￭.
I sincerely hope that we will ￭, not just in these last few days of our presidency ￭, but afterwards as well ￭.
The European Parliament has discussed these questions on numerous occasions ￭, e ￭.￭ g ￭. ￭, in relation to the street children of Guatemala ￭.
I will not contribute to this ￭.
We supported democratic elections in Palestine and ended up with a government run by a movement which figures on our list of international terrorists ￭.
In this way ￭, important pieces of standard mail would be included in the reduced rate range ￭. This includes newspapers ￭, week￭ lies and other par￭ c￭ els ￭.
It took very little time to draft this report entitled '￭ Cohesion Policy ￭: Inv￭ esting in the real economy ￭' ￭.
I can give you an example of my own country ￭, where the major financial groups are so well established that they make profits of 90 ￭% ￭, which clearly demonstrates that customers are suffering ￭.
As always ￭, this has been done very thoroughly ￭.
We should deal with the problem by using a sectoral approach ￭.
Mr President ￭, here we are again discussing Turkey ￭.
We Moder￭ ates are of the opinion that direct support for the production of tobacco ￭, olives ￭, cotton and hop￭ s should be ph￭ ased out ￭.
It is insul￭ ting for us to play sem￭ antic games about the definition of this word ￭.
So they are to be left out of the discussion ￭.
We in the European Parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world ￭.
These consequences are firstly social ￭: we need simply think of the un￭ motivated violence of so many young people ￭, gang￭ s of y￭ ou￭ ths ￭, road accidents ￭, Saturday night destruction and ￭, finally ￭, the increase in suicide ￭.
Russia is sk￭ il￭ fully using its position as a monopo￭ list on the European energy market ￭.
I also wish to congratulate this Parliament and all the political groups on having united over this serious situation ￭, thereby demonstrating that the European Parliament is not turning its back on the citizens ￭' problems and that it can put this communication to the benefit of society and of Europe ￭'￭ s citizens ￭.
The situation at Chernobyl ￭, where appropriations are being dis￭ bur￭ sed only me￭ agre￭ ly ￭, despite a gl￭ aring lack of safety ￭, demonstrates how alarming this can be ￭.
Madam President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council ￭, I may be exagg￭ erating a bit ￭, but I fear that the reality is rather like that in some areas ￭.
I hope ￭, on the basis of Mr van N￭ ist￭ el￭ ro￭ oi￭ j ￭'￭ s excellent report ￭, that territorial cohesion will become the legal basis under￭ p￭ inning harmoni￭ ous development in all regions of the Union ￭, allowing the best characteristics to be drawn from each European region ￭.
This ￭, however ￭, provides an additional reason for establishing a common reference framework ￭.
So ￭, Mrs M￭ ous￭ k￭ ouri ￭, many thanks for your report ￭, which I am sure will work in that direction ￭.
Before the European Council in March and the presentation by the Member States of their national targets in April ￭, we gave our verdict on the EU 2020 Strategy ￭.
We have no clear policy on this issue ￭.
I think we really have to get down to work on this ￭.
Let me clarify this aspect ￭: what we want to have done ￭, by that date ￭, is to have begun the discussions that will lead to a shift in the focus of the common agricultural policy ￭, not ￭, obviously ￭, to a thorough reform of it ￭.
Therefore ￭, we have to be very careful and responsible during its setting ￭-￭ up ￭.
Mr President ￭, Commissioner ￭, firstly ￭, I want to say that Mr Tan￭ nock ￭’￭ s report on the European neighbourhood policy is a document I fully support ￭, and I can only congratulate him on his excellent work ￭.
It is even more amazing that the Council is hin￭ der￭ ing this from happening ￭.
Do you consider ￭, given the spirit of the Helsinki resolutions ￭, which call on Turkey to settle its border and similar disputes with its neighbours by 2004 ￭, that the status of the island ro￭ cks or grey zones in the A￭ eg￭ ean counts as a border dispute ￭?
. Mr President ￭, the Commission ￭’￭ s obligation is to ensure compliance with the Treaties and it goes without saying that on previous occasions ￭, when the eurozone was created ￭, or when the twel￭ f￭ th member of the eurozone joined ￭, the Commission and the Council of the time ￭, with the opinion of the European Parliament ￭, took account of the obligation to ensure compliance with the Treaties ￭.
Pro￭ grammes will not start on 1 January 2000 ￭, but we need to minimise delays in order not to fall into the problems and tr￭ aps of the previous round of funding where late starts led to problems of under￭ sp￭ ends ￭, delays in projects ￭, project canc￭ ell￭ ations and difficulties in sust￭ aining matched funding ￭.
It will seriously undermine the confidence of WTO members in that system ￭.
It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors ￭.
I have carefully noted what was said – not necessarily in order or by whom ￭, though that has also been noted elsewhere ￭.
In such cases ￭, European taxpayers are paying double ￭.
Madam President ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, it is true ￭, as Mrs L￭ inde￭ per￭ g has said ￭, that a few small steps forward have been taken as regards the third pillar ￭, but ￭, as the previous speakers have so rightly said ￭, there has been a marked lack of political objectives - a lack that has led national ego￭ isms to eat away at the very heart of state sovereignty ￭, as the President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council has said ￭.
As I understand it ￭, the immigration policy that we must al￭ ign ourselves to has to be based on the rights of the European Union ￭'￭ s Member States to retain full control over the number of workers who are granted right of entry ￭.
Why should young Europeans ￭, properly trained and educated ￭, not contribute to defe￭ ating unemployment in Europe as well as contributing to safer seas worldwide ￭?
I hope colleagues will support me as rapporteur in trying to re￭ inst￭ ate ha￭ ke in this report ￭.
This phenomenon is extremely important to the European Parliament ￭, and so we very much welcome this cooperation between the Commission ￭, the Council and ourselves ￭.
It is also worth no￭ ting that the soil ￭'￭ s ability to absorb carbon and convert it into useful hum￭ us has not yet been fully exploited ￭.
It is a parad￭ ox that the majority of NGOs that play an active role in peace negotiations and post ￭-￭ conflict processes are made up of women ￭.
I would like to remind you that this is not a CM￭ O ￭.
Secondly ￭, it is the first multilateral agreement that applies to the whole of south ￭-￭ east Europe since the break ￭-￭ up of the former Yugoslavia ￭.
The European Union has a responsibility to convey clear messages on the importance of democracy ￭, human rights and respect for the rule of law ￭.
Nevertheless there is no shortage of people in Slovenia ￭, too ￭, who claim that culture is merely something superflu￭ ous and unnecessary ￭, since it brings in no money directly ￭.
But this report goes to the Council as well as to Parliament ￭, and we shall be discussing it again with the Council ￭.
However ￭, given that it meets the European Parliament ￭'￭ s request for a comprehensive approach to create a true internal market in services ￭, I trust that Members will give it due consideration and start to discuss it in order to provide a sound basis for the new Parliament ￭'￭ s work and show the way to the Council of Ministers ￭.
The United Kingdom Conservatives and Socialists are opposed to those two conference rooms ￭, as they would spo￭ il the very pleasant entrance to the European Parliament by the flags ￭.
So EURO￭ POL must have a strong interest in co ￭-￭ operating with the countries of origin of organized crime ￭, especially in the east ￭.
I think ￭, however ￭, that it would have been more logical to refer in full to Article 37 of the Treaty ￭, which represents the very foundation of the fisheries and agricultural policies ￭, had this Article not proved lacking as regards the EU ￭'￭ s outermost regions ￭.
Likewise ￭, the provision of information on human rights is not sufficiently categ￭ orical ￭.
We are therefore not in￭ different to a political development which may lead to the presence ￭, in the executive bodies of a Member State government and therefore a friendly government which shares with us and which has decided to share with us a basic set of principles ￭, of a party which clearly conducted an electoral campaign based on other principles ￭.
I am convinced that Europe will only re￭ ap benefits of the digital revolution if all EU citizens are mobil￭ ised and empowered to participate fully in the new digital society ￭.
At the same time ￭, it notes that the Member States of the Union have different definitions for national ￭, ethnic and religious minorities and sections of the population within their borders ￭, based on their laws and ￭/￭ or international conventions (￭ as in the case of Greece ￭) and that these must not under any circumstances be thought to be contested or affected by this resolution ￭.
That is an issue which will be coming before Parliament in due course ￭.
Finally ￭, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur ￭, Mr Paolo Costa ￭, for convincing the Council to accept the majority of the European Parliament ￭'￭ s amendments ￭.
P￭ reservation of this system ￭, which is full of inequalities ￭, is a mistake we cannot accept ￭.
With regard to Thursday and the debate on oral questions to the Commission on water management in Europe ￭, the Group of the European People ￭' s Party (￭ Christian Democrats ￭) and European Democrats has requested that this debate not be followed by a resolution ￭.
The review of this policy must be accompanied by the introduction of a set of political criteria that neighbouring countries should meet in order to obtain a superior status in their relations with the EU ￭.
Kno￭ wing that the quota ￭-￭ hop￭ ping issue is a very sensitive one ￭, not just for the British but equally so for the Spanish ￭, Mrs Bonino as the Commissioner responsible and I myself wanted to ensure that the Spanish authorities were always kept informed about contacts with the British authorities ￭.
I make no secret that this was a difficult case for the committee ￭.
There is little confidence in the European institutions ￭, and the individual citizen can feel that the gap between '￭ those in Brussels ￭' and '￭ those of us at home ￭' is extremely large ￭.
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century ￭.
The Commission also remains active in the humanitarian situation ￭.
All in all ￭, this report is making a strong point ￭, from the European Parliament side ￭, that we need effective measures to tackle this important issue ￭.
I have special mis￭ gi￭ v￭ ings regarding Amendments Nos 6 and 7 ￭, which Mr Crowley referred to in particular ￭.
But there are gains there for everyone ￭.
Long ￭-￭ term plans constitute an important instrument in fisheries management ￭, enabling the essential conservation of fisheries resources at sustainable levels to be combined with guaranteed medium ￭-￭ term prospects for expl￭ oiting these resources ￭, which is indispensable for giving economic and social stability to fishing and the local communities that depend on it ￭.
The fact that the Court of Auditors has established that error rates are in decline is therefore praise for the work of the previous Commission in external aid ￭, in development cooperation and in enlargement policy ￭.
The compromise in the Council of Ministers is a balanced one and comes 14 years after Sweden introduced its national ban on mercury ther￭ mom￭ eters ￭.
I have three points to make ￭.
EU Heads of State or Government ￭, be warned – you are heading for a confrontation with the peoples of Europe ￭.
As demographic change is influenc￭ ing relationships in our society ￭, it is particularly important that one generation is not living at the expense of another ￭.
In the view of the liberal group ￭, unlike that of the two major groups ￭, it consequently seems hardly too much to ask for men and women to be able to make use of existing rights to combine work and care tasks without experiencing discrimination ￭.
There would be a significant temptation to do this ￭.
I have taken the floor today to call on the Presidency to send a letter ￭, or take any other measure it de￭ ems appropriate ￭, with regard to what is happening to A￭ fr￭ o ￭-￭ Colombi￭ an communities on the Pacific coast of Colombia at the moment ￭.
Consequently ￭, the EU should not only broad￭ en the scope of the political dialogue by adding more partners ￭, but should also complement it by integrating social and economic strategy as a priority ￭.
Mr S￭ kin￭ ner said that both the amount and allocation of risk capital remains sub ￭-￭ optimal compared to the United States ￭, and unfortunately this overall gap is widening all the time ￭.
These are harsh tru￭ ths ￭, but we would do well to face up to them ￭.
Another important issue is the region￭ alisation of the common fisheries policy ￭.
In so doing ￭, the idea is to utilise existing resources and to tie in with existing structures ￭; the European Dem￭ ographic For￭ ums launched by the Commission in its Communication will be particularly important reference points in this regard ￭.
In other words ￭, we are still a long way from where we want to be ￭.
The ratification by Moldova in October of this year of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court is a very positive step in this direction ￭.
I feel that this means there is a fundamental contradiction in the directive ￭'￭ s approach ￭, which we cannot support as it is proposed here ￭.
Mr President ￭, on a point of order ￭, I would like to bring to your attention ￭, and I hope this will not take up part of my speaking time ￭, that I have received no news relating to the absence of the Commissioner responsible ￭, Mr Patten ￭.
The President of the Commission and all the Commissioners should continue in their present direction ￭: they can count on Parliament ￭’￭ s support as demonstrated by the desire to reach a unified resolution on this sensitive and important issue ￭, which I think will be adopted unanimously ￭.
The other heads of state and government should also reflect why ￭, on the threshold of a new French presidency ￭, we have come full circle since the last ￭: from Nice to Nice ￭.
I call for the creation of a more SME ￭-￭ friendly regulatory environment by carefully assessing the impact of any new regulatory or legislative measures on SMEs ￭, with a view to cutting red tape ￭, boosting competitiveness and promoting quality employment ￭.
It suggested that the United Kingdom should not publish the results of research ￭.
I would end by making it clear that the draft legislative resolution before you was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Fisheries and the two amendments tabled by our committee which accompany it ￭, Nos 1 and 2 ￭, are merely amendments to improve the proposal ￭.
It is high time we had an independent European food inspec￭ torate ￭.
. Mr President ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, the Council believes that the strategic partnership with Russia must be based on the common values endorsed in the Partnership and Co ￭-￭ operation Agreement ￭, especially those to which Russia is committed as a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co ￭-￭ operation in Europe ￭.
Mr Mc￭ Mill￭ an ￭-￭ Scott ￭, the reason that there is no resolution tabled is because the Conference of Presidents believed that there are no grounds for one ￭.
The first problem is a degree of uncertainty in the House as to how to deal with the special relationship between lawyers and their clients ￭, because we are calling for a reporting obligation if money laundering is suspected ￭.
the Harrison report (￭ A ￭4 ￭-￭ 0￭ 160 ￭/￭ 97 ￭)
Madam President ￭, the more recent history of the Great L￭ akes States contains ￭, in embryo ￭, the gen￭ esis of genocide ￭: the T￭ ut￭ sis who have seized power in Rwanda ￭, the T￭ ut￭ sis who are in power in Burundi and the T￭ ut￭ sis living in the neighbouring Kiv￭ u are creating a de facto T￭ ut￭ si feder￭ ation of the Great L￭ akes ￭.
That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level ￭.
This will also contribute to the development of an entrepreneur￭ ial tradition and make it easier to meet the challenges of globalisation ￭.
The first step will be to foster the creation of aids for small and medium ￭-￭ sized enterprises in the telecommunications sector ￭, which are gener￭ ators of a high percentage of job creation in Europe ￭, as well as improving the infrastructures which these enterprises install where there is a lack of telecommunications networks and where it is far from convenient to do so ￭.
Without a doubt ￭, in the form proposed by the Commission these provisions are indeed open to abuse - and this abuse can also take the form of s￭ lowing down projects ￭.
It is a new ￭, very ambitious beginning ￭.
But I hope she recogni￭ zes that UR￭ BAN has provided an ideal opportunity to develop the sort of bottom ￭-￭ up Community initiatives that the Commission has promoted in its economic development plans and has provided a very good vehicle for promoting the Community with the citizens because of its very local ￭, neighbourhood ￭-￭ level focus ￭.
Sometimes we vote on things which on reflection we regret ￭.
Now ￭, of course ￭, some of our colleagues are trying to win more seats for their own Member State ￭, sometimes arguing that their country ￭'￭ s population is suddenly much bigger than we had all assumed be￭ fore￭ hand ￭, bigger than the Eurostat figures that are used by everybody ￭, including the Council ￭.
On this issue ￭, I think that the meeting in the Commission ￭, which was extremely interesting and liv￭ ely ￭, enabled us to reach a relative consensus ￭.
No other issue has taken Parliament so long to deal with as that of animal testing in the matter of cosmetic products ￭.
I welcome the desire to facilitate the exchange of information ￭, to improve and to consolidate cooperation between customs authorities ￭, and the establishment of procedures for joint actions ￭.
The need for economic and political reforms in this country is greater than ever ￭.
Mov￭ ing on to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of Nice ￭, I would first of all like to pay heart￭ felt tribute to Michel Barnier for his work ￭.
In addition ￭, with the aim of perfec￭ ting the existing regulation ￭, the Commission ￭, probably during this first sem￭ ester ￭, will submit a proposal concerning the raw materials destined for the animal feed sector that have been genetically modified ￭.
B￭ earing in mind that Europe is to host the forthcoming Olympic Games ￭, can the Commission say whether it will take measures to tackle this problem ￭, possibly as part of the campaign against dop￭ ing which has already been launched and with reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ￭?
I see the response of the Commission and the European Union in the area of cultural diversity as being structured around three main lines ￭.
Ir￭ respective of its technical condition ￭, a ship in danger must have access to a specially designated and equipped refuge area ￭.
The information society remo￭ ves the need for teachers and students to be in the same place at the same time ￭.
The sometimes scandalous behaviour of the authorities must not incite us to showing more complaisance towards the Islamic terrorists ￭.
The other impe￭ di￭ ment is the Middle East problem ￭.
The Commission views this amendment as a sign of support for the efforts it is already making ￭, within the appropriate legal framework ￭, to ensure proper application of the procedures for the granting of visas and to evaluate the adequacy of these measures ￭, a matter it will subsequently report on to Parliament ￭.
Mr Chirac said that Dublin had given us an image of a new Europe ￭.
I think ￭, however ￭, that we should make amendments to the proposal to guarantee security ￭.
The desire to stand￭ ardi￭ ze everything or the useful and functional nature of the legislation ￭?
No means deemed inadmissible under signed international conventions may be used ￭.
We are still very uncertain about the effectiveness of a military option which should not be envisaged unless all diplomatic instruments have failed ￭.
How then do I sum up our creative achievements ￭?
The Heads of State and Government have opted for liberal choices by fav￭ ouring the spe￭ eding ￭-￭ up of deregulation and liberalisation ￭, wage moder￭ ation ￭, and flexibility and insecurity in the labour market ￭.
I believe that both sides need to change their spots and it is clear that both sides are ready to take a step forward ￭.
But I recognise that it is particularly important to those Member States that have joined the European Union recently ￭.
Gr￭ at￭ eful though I am for this report ￭, what I propose goes well beyond it ￭: we in this House ￭, as the representatives of the European citizens ￭, should present the Council with an ulti￭ mat￭ um ￭, with the end of this year as the deadline ￭.
I nevertheless understand those here who intend to vote against this legislative proposal tomorrow ￭.
At the Employment Summit in Luxembourg in 1997 ￭, action plans were decided upon to combat long ￭-￭ term and youth unemployment ￭, and to move from passive to active measures ￭.
Secondly ￭, the new Member States are ￭, in principle ￭, to participate in all common policy areas ￭, in certain cases only after agreed transitional periods ￭, although it should be noted that such transitional periods may be requested both by the candidate countries and also ￭, in individual cases ￭, by us ￭.
We need to ensure that the bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries do not end￭ anger the efforts made at European level ￭.
We need people where they are ￭, and that is where we have to communicate with them ￭; it cannot be done from Brussels ￭.
For Europe ￭, today ￭, that would be the equivalent of EUR 400 billion per year over several years ￭.
This indicates in the first place that we should make a distinction between temporary disruption (￭ use of airspace by the military for Kosovo ￭, the change in the control system ￭, etc ￭. ￭) and structural problems ￭.
European citizenship which is imp￭ licit in this right to vote in municipal elections goes hand in hand with the respect of minority groups and ￭, more broadly ￭, has to do with the defence of our values which are tolerance ￭, respect for differences and mutual comprehen￭ sion ￭.
Your proposal only to work with those organisations which represent exclusively the Member States of the European Union or to which at least two Member States belong is not one I can accept ￭, because we also attach great importance to working with international organisations ￭, which of course have to show an appropriate European dimension ￭.
In addition ￭, the investments in the energy infrastructure ￭, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources will reduce the EU ￭'￭ s energy dependency and generate roughly 2 ￭.￭ 7 million new jobs by 2030 ￭.
And this effect will be all the more pronounced if the euro does not produce all the benefits expected ￭.
I am therefore pleased that we are calling on the Commission to take action in this area ￭.
Stabilisation of the euro will make it easier for them to fulfil their ambitions of joining this area ￭, and may protect the entire system from further turbul￭ ence ￭.
These implications ￭, starting with the initial time fr￭ ames ￭, warrant a great deal of attention in our view ￭, and they must be addressed with all due rig￭ our ￭.
I also have no doubt that elements within the main Albanian political parties were involved ￭.
Glob￭ ally ￭, 10 million hectares are lost every day ￭.
This requires more and better public services ￭, with a guarantee of equal access for all ￭.
We must also send a message to the national governments and regional and local authorities ￭, since policies at those levels must conver￭ ge and be consistent with those of the European Union ￭.
These rules ￭, which in their current form work against the Lisbon Strategy and in favour of the big corporations that have come to terms with them in the hope of market dominance ￭, are damaging to SMEs ￭.
How the history books could have been written differently if respect for the Irish vote from British colleagues was always there ￭!
In practice ￭, the tendency seems to be rather for the European Council to assume this role ￭. Its members alone are empowered to carry out the necessary arbitr￭ ation ￭, at both internal and Union level ￭.
But that is the outcome of the discussions in committee ￭, and tomorrow we shall have a more positive result ￭.
Personally ￭, I should have preferred the Commission to present us with an entirely new version ￭, rather than pi￭ ec￭ em￭ e￭ al amendments here and there ￭, because the Commission ￭' s text gave rise to almost 200 amendments by the rapporteur and the various committees involved ￭, and these were often drawn up without reference to the basic text ￭, and with the intention ￭, albeit worthy ￭, of trying in that directive to re￭ inv￭ ent the entire policy on equality in a number of other fields covered by other directives ￭.
In addition ￭, existing legislation - the Cross ￭-￭ B￭ order M￭ erg￭ ers Directive - provides a framework for the transfer ￭, including the necessary safeguards for third parties ￭.
The medicinal products market is unique and our objective must not be to encourage maximum sales ￭.
His condition is very ￭, very serious ￭.
But you can be sure that we are going to try ￭, and we are going to try to support Mr Fay￭ y￭ ad ￭, because he has been our interlocu￭ tor all this period of time ￭.
Furthermore ￭, the adoption of the regulation on construction products constitutes an important step forward in terms of simplifying and improving the legislation ￭, whilst ￭, at the same time ￭, consolidating the internal market for construction products ￭.
As has already been pointed out ￭, this is a very widespread phenomenon ￭, especially in the economies of certain emerging States ￭.
I am of course concerned to know how another country ￭, Spain ￭, was able to export almost 9 000 tonnes of tuna in 2006 when it only declared having captured 4 700 tonnes ￭, as organisations such as Green￭ peace or Ad￭ ena have noted ￭.
I say this as an enthusias￭ tic supporter of regulations because ￭, when directives are implemented ￭, they generally bring new distortions of competition in their wake in my country ￭.
Andersson report (￭ A ￭4 ￭-￭ 3￭ 13 ￭/￭ 97 ￭)
(￭ RO ￭) 2010 is the year when we will carry out a mid ￭-￭ term review of the way in which the Structural Funds are being used ￭, and I think that priority must be given to energy efficiency ￭.
, President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council ￭.
It is to be regret￭ ted ￭, though ￭, that all of them need to make greater efforts in such important areas as financial management and financial control ￭.
As Mrs Gr￭ ö￭ ner stated ￭, there has been a lot of interest in seeking funds from the previous D￭ AP￭ H￭ NE Programme ￭, and there were far more high ￭-￭ quality projects than there was money for ￭.
We also rejo￭ ice that these nations are members of the NATO alliance ￭, the most successful defence organisation the world has ever seen ￭.
These are not secondary issues ￭: they are fundamental conditions for setting up and using the information systems in question ￭.
International cooperation is the bottom line ￭.
Consequently ￭, I believe that the wording of paragraph 12 ￭.￭ 5 - as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs - is extremely important ￭.
In conclusion ￭, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 6 and Nos 8 ￭, 9 and 11 ￭, but is obliged to reject Amendments Nos 7 ￭, 10 and 12 ￭.
Of course ￭, we need to do that ￭, but no matter how often or how well we do that ￭, there will still be a need for people to move into the weal￭ th￭ ier parts of Europe ￭.
That way ￭, the public knows of the documents and can challenge such classification ￭.
The conclusions are brief and clear and speak for themselves ￭, but I would like to highlight the major decisions ￭.
One of the priorities identified is the need for improved access to finance for SMEs ￭.
Quite frankly ￭, we cannot integrate by law those who do not wish to integrate ￭, those who are not prepared to move forward ￭, those who think that Europe can still tolerate forced marri￭ ages or poly￭ gam￭ y ￭.
Finally we also highlight the importance ￭, in all awareness and education campaigns ￭, of the ability to recognise the symptoms of dem￭ entia ￭.
In this respect it is clear that at the very moment when the P￭ KK - from which my group and all other groups have always dist￭ anced themselves - unilaterally declar￭ es a cease ￭-￭ fire in order to seek a solution by alternative means ￭, Turkey has decided to resort to this sort of action ￭.
Mr President ￭, this week in Barcelona the European Council will gather in order to seek to build upon the Lisbon Process ￭.
In conclusion ￭, I hope that the Council and the Commission ￭, together with the European Parliament ￭, especially given the im￭ pending start of the Italian Presidency ￭, will create better geopolitical conditions for carrying through the project for a renewed Europe ￭, a Europe which is not just politically wider but which has grown in economic and social terms too ￭, so that countries which are different but which have common interests make up a healthy whole ￭, despite the differences in their history and individual experiences ￭.
Anti ￭-￭ dumping measures must not be ab￭ used for protectionist purposes ￭.
It is also important to point out that the text we are discussing today is only a bill at this stage ￭, presented by a few members of the Lithuanian Parliament ￭.
We face a serious problem ￭.
. I have the luxury of being able to address the Parliament twice in succession ￭.
I know that Mrs Read does not intend to stand for re ￭-￭ election to this House ￭.
The Commission has drawn valuable lessons from Eurocontrol ￭'￭ s successes and has integrated them into the proposals ￭, but it has also tried to address its shortcomings ￭.
The use of dop￭ ing in sport must be seen against this background ￭.
The Presidency did not agree with these views ￭.
We also admi￭ re the immediate reaction and effort of the people of the province ￭, who are helping in the rescue operation ￭.
A WTO Plus agreement will push the people of Africa even further into the ab￭ y￭ ss of poverty ￭.
I believe - and this is what makes it so interesting - that the market economy is there in the first place for the benefit of the consumer and therefore stands in the way of monopo￭ lists ￭.
What is happening today in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe on a major scale ￭.
It has not been easy ￭, but foremost has been the desire for a legal text which is a good instrument for providing women with equal access to the labour market under equal conditions and for allowing them to reconcile family and professional lives ￭, which still causes women enormous problems ￭, especially young women ￭.
No one should rejo￭ ice pre￭ mat￭ u￭ rely at the present vic￭ iss￭ itu￭ des of the single currency ￭.
The Netherlands already has a notification centre and my country ￭, Flanders ￭, is also looking into the subject ￭.
I would particularly like to thank the European Trade Union Confederation ￭, which has been working with us to advocate protection ￭, without falling into the trap of national narrow ￭-￭ min￭ de￭ dness ￭.
If these studies only analyse the legal position ￭, however ￭, and not the differences between the Member States in terms of the enforcement of their own laws ￭, these studies will bring us no further forward at the end of the day ￭.
I strongly believe that the implementation of this resolution will enable the European Union not only to help promote a peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue through negotiations in a more consistent ￭, effective and creative way but also provide support for other legitimate needs of the Tibetan people ￭, including ways and means to preserve our distinct identity ￭.
The European Commission will examine various measures ￭, again in the light of state aid rules ￭, on compensation for the cost of additional insurance and continuing state intervention up to the end of this year ￭.
(￭ The President cut off the speaker ￭. ￭)
They have also brought about a bottom ￭-￭ up philosophy that had never been appreciated before ￭.
The other point I want to bring into this is the lack of dialogue between the different institutions and the operators themselves ￭.
No ￭, I really think we should not close our eyes to reality here but make our contribution towards reducing the risks in nuclear as in other forms of technology ￭.
It was only later that ￭, I have to say with full respect to the services of this House ￭, they thoroughly confused everything by saying that these two paragraphs could not be included ￭, and they removed them against the will of the political groups ￭.
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon ￭.
I am very happy that the report was unanimously accepted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ￭.
Unless we get that money and unless universities are properly and adequately funded ￭, we will not have balanced courses ￭, we will not have balanced discipline and we will not be able to give our students the chances that they need ￭.
Members of the European Parliament ￭, before you give this Commission power ￭, remember that 60 years ago ￭, an Iron Cur￭ tain came down on Europe but now ￭, with this Commission ￭, there is an economic iron f￭ ist and it is being felt in Greece today ￭.
Mr President ￭, as the second half of 1997 comes to an end ￭, one might be temp￭ ted to think that the maintenance of statutory equality within the European Union prev￭ ails over all other considerations ￭.
Mr President ￭, it is useful to meet our constituents during the summer break ￭, and in two ￭-￭ and ￭-￭ a ￭-￭ half hours last Friday I heard of the p￭ light of Irish dairy farmers resulting from the over ￭-￭ severe implementation of CAP reform by the Commission and the Council ￭.
This being the case ￭, the European Union depl￭ ores the decision taken on 13 October in the American Senate not to ratify the Test Ban Treaty ￭.
Furthermore ￭, international medical associations are making plain that there is still a need for morph￭ ine today ￭, not only in the South of the world ￭, but paradox￭ ically in the North too ￭.
The responsibility and future of the EU also encomp￭ ass a global responsibility ￭.
A majority on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market dis￭ agrees with this approach ￭; the fact is that calculating risks is what insurance companies do ￭, and where there are different levels of risk ￭, these may be taken into account ￭.
For our Group ￭, this means ￭, above all ￭, finally establishing a common legal immigration policy which safeguards the human rights of migrants and offers prospects to people in great need who enter Europe ￭, often ris￭ king their lives to do so ￭.
At the same time you have achieved an important breakthrough in the tax system ￭.
As President of our Parliament ￭, I have had the opportunity to learn some pr￭ ic￭ eless lessons ￭.
In the committee you will continue as the rapporteur ￭.
This would not only support and encourage mobility ￭, but would also increase general acceptance of the EU ￭, and improve contact and understanding between individual Member States ￭.
As is well known ￭, the origins of our religious institution lie at the core of the A￭ xi￭ al Age ￭, deep in the history of the Christian Fa￭ ith - with the earliest follow￭ ers of Jesus Christ ￭.
He has argued his case well enough to justify his appointment to the Court of Auditors ￭, and to perform his duties cap￭ ably and independently ￭.
This report by Mrs Mu￭ ñ￭ i￭ z De Ur￭ qui￭ za is on the EU ￭'￭ s performance as a global player and its role in multilateral organisations ￭.
In these conditions ￭, I do not understand why Members themselves were not involved in this dialogue ￭, and Members are ￭, moreover ￭, requesting that all representatives be involved in all of the dialogues ￭, irrespective of the structure of these dialogues ￭.
Would you and your group now distance yourself from your support for this flo￭ til￭ la in the same way as happened yesterday here in Parliament with the substantial involvement of the Con￭ federal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left ￭?
For us an annual growth limit in pe￭ at is quite enough ￭.
This House directly represents the European citizens ￭, and it is clear that it has the primary task of building the new Europe ￭.
I want particularly to support the amendments from my colleagues Mr Hend￭ rick and Mme García Ari￭ as which talk about the possible abuses of dominant positions ￭.
Yet there are those who want to restrict us yet further and who would de￭ em the report ambitious ￭. That is why this House should adopt the report ￭.
To date ￭, however ￭, there has been no European ￭-￭ level harmonisation of the rules on contracts for consumers and businesses ￭.
I suppose a recommendation is really rather the equivalent of us all moving down into the centre of Strasbourg and attending the cathedral in order to make an act of collective pr￭ ayer ￭.
If that is so ￭, how come foreign ministers were unable recently to make any formal response to President Bush ￭’￭ s admission of CIA secret prisons ￭, just as they were unable to do anything about Guantánamo for four years ￭?
However ￭, I feel that when it comes to moun￭ ting such an extensive operation ￭, we must take stock of the need for aid before opening our wall￭ et ￭.
Incid￭ entally ￭, as an aside ￭, as some of you have referred to statements that I made when presenting the recommendations for the Greek Programme ￭, I ask you ￭, in the interests of confidence ￭, to refer to what I actually said ￭, rather than referring to what others say that I supposedly said ￭.
Mil￭ lions of people in Africa are dying every year of diseases capable of being treated with drugs that have existed for years in the industrialised countries ￭.
Finally ￭, a number of additional amendments have been tabled ￭.
I would emphasize that this does not mean that these are cases of fraud ￭; they are irregularities in the broad￭ est sense ￭, including many things such as in￭ accurate reporting of set ￭-￭ aside areas ￭, for example ￭.
So the nature of the problem did not change ￭.
If you want to know why Europe is un￭ popular in many areas of the European Union ￭, just look at this type of proposal ￭.
Mr President ￭, Mr President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, the Commission welcomes the report by the honourable Member Mr Rocard ￭, which basically discus￭ ses what relevance developments in the Arab world have to us and what we can do to exert our influence over these developments ￭.
Let me quote from a letter I received from a constituent in Corn￭ wall ￭.
Without prejudice to the future of the Community institutions ￭, this text provides a particularly interesting basis for an excellent debate and ￭, moreover ￭, is proof of the maturity of this House ￭, if indeed that still needed to be demonstrated ￭.
. With regard to paragraph 27 ￭, I agree with the Socialist and Liberal Groups that we should replace the words '￭ high capital ￭' with '￭ appropriate capital ￭' and take out the last few words ￭: '￭ as has happened during the various crises ￭, including in the case of the L￭ T￭ CM crisis ￭. ￭'
Lastly ￭, what use will the meeting of the WTO in Canc￭ un be if the European Union does not stand up to the United States ￭' continuing failure to move on certain issues ￭, especially that of allowing poor countries to access generic medicines ￭?
Thus Europe is in effect absent ￭, while the Serbian forces are del￭ aying their withdrawal ￭, playing on the mis￭ understand￭ ings and inv￭ ective within NATO ￭. Meanwhile M￭ la￭ dic and Kar￭ ad￭ z￭ ic are still on the run ￭, ev￭ ading international justice ￭, and the Serbian authorities are being allowed to mu￭ zzle the press ￭, closing down on a f￭ lim￭ sy pretext all newspapers which disagree with the regime ￭.
Today ￭, those who leave their farm to their children risk leaving them with a hand￭ ful of debts ￭.
I tell you that is ut￭ ter rub￭ b￭ ish ￭, we need uranium for nuclear power ￭, and we have to import that as well ￭, so let us just be clear on that point ￭!
I believe we all agree on the need for regional integration ￭.
How ￭, then ￭, is the recent unilateral decision by the Russian Government to impose a visa regime for the citizens of Georgia to be interpreted except as deliberate o￭ str￭ ac￭ ism sever￭ ing economic trade and historic links between the formerly frat￭ ern￭ al Soviet states ￭.
They should ensure that there is greater stability in the field of financial services and ￭, where trade agreements are concerned ￭, they should ensure that social standards are gradually raised across the board so as to contribute to there being greater justice in this world ￭.
I fear either the company will re￭ locate ￭, or the markets they serve will be met by other suppliers outside the EU ￭.
Domestic government and national central banks are best placed to respond to changing economic circumstances ￭, and that is why I have always opposed measures that have undermined economic sovereignty ￭.
That is why we expect all parties to emb￭ ark on this peace process ￭.
To sum up ￭, I should like to emphasize the importance of these networks ￭.
The coal mine clos￭ ures may have a major social impact ￭, contributing to the rise in unemployment and exacerb￭ ating the de￭ population of regions which only have one industry - mining ￭.
Indeed ￭, the great historic origin￭ ality of our work is to devise a democratic structure that goes beyond the nation state in the era of globalisation ￭.
I think that Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives would lead to legal uncertainty which would make the harmonisation of European rules necessary ￭.
I regret that the report focuses solely on distribu￭ tors instead of taking account of the production chain as a whole ￭.
For its part ￭, the official newspaper of the regime of Transnis￭ tria ￭’￭ s President S￭ mir￭ no￭ v is advocating the of Moldova and calling for help to democrati￭ se the country ￭, or in other words to rid the Republic of Moldova of the Commun￭ ists and their leader ￭.
(￭ More than twelve Members of Parliament rise to their feet ￭) (￭ Parliament adopted the resolution ￭)
I should like to say that if Amendment No 14 is adopted ￭, No 4 does not lap￭ se ￭.
Much of the funding will be directed towards major cross ￭-￭ border projects ￭, but I do not believe that this can be effective without all countries concerned signing binding bilateral agreements ￭.
It is neither our policy nor our custom to ask everyone for their pass￭ ports ￭, but it has to be recognized that the humanitarian area is extremely restricted or no longer exists in this zone ￭.
Next there is the question of transl￭ ating the Treaties into a constitution ￭, to respond to the twin requirement of clari￭ fying the texts ￭, which we must render more cog￭ ent and more accessible to our fellow citizens ￭, and of inter￭ linking compet￭ encies more smoothly ￭.
I believe it is the only country in the world which execu￭ tes pregnant women ￭.
We would certainly want to push that agenda at the Council and hope to achieve in the future support from our other colleagues ￭.
Mr President ￭, over ￭-￭ production of sugar is another manifestation of the ob￭ scene common agricultural policy that protects certain producers for political reasons and pen￭ alises consumers for the same political reasons ￭.
I spoke on Saturday ￭, after the referendum result from Ireland was known ￭, with the T￭ ao￭ is￭ each Brian Cow￭ en ￭, who said they would need a couple of weeks to secure full parliamentary ratification ￭, and therefore we can also say that country number 26 will finally be Ireland ￭.
I hope the three institutions reach an agreement quickly so that this office can open as soon as possible ￭.
The Commission shares the view that any approach to soil protection must take account of the considerable diversity of regional and local conditions that exist across Europe ￭.
There are many ways of making Europe useful to its people through citizens ￭' rights ￭.
The reporter - and the Legal Affairs Committee agrees with him - advocates a directive ￭, because the Member States can apply that more flexi￭ bly ￭.

I hope that the Union will still be able to equi￭ p itself with independent global navigation systems ￭, and will exploit its full potential ￭, in order to promote the strengthening of the economy ￭, increased employment and transport safety ￭.
The fact is that the EU provides aid to E￭ rit￭ rea ￭, and a total of EUR 122 million has been budg￭ eted for E￭ rit￭ rea for the period 2009 ￭-￭ 2013 ￭.
That is why the Herman report contains both criticisms of the Commission ￭'￭ s structures and self ￭-￭ criticism of our own procedures ￭.
Investment - and future investment - could possibly have the biggest impact on the shape of our future economic partnership with Mercosur ￭.
Ireland has been bul￭ lied into holding a second vote ￭, but the Irish people are unlikely to take kind￭ ly to being treated with such cont￭ empt ￭.
- (￭ CS ￭) Ladies and gentlemen ￭, when fighting unemployment ￭, the objective at the heart of the strategy is to make it easier for employees to adapt to the labour market ￭, and this can be achieved through lifelong learning ￭.
in writing ￭. - The pay gap ￭, which was one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs but which has not been adequately addressed by some Member States ￭, has a serious impact on the status of women in economic and social life ￭.
This is more and more difficult ￭.
This ￭, too ￭, is lacking in the Community ￭, because mad cow disease is the result of a violation of nature and the genetically modified maize that we debated here yesterday is also a violation ￭. Likewise ￭, the continued production of nuclear waste by leading Community countries for dumping in various regions of the Community and elsewhere is a violation of nature ￭.
In￭ ter ￭-￭ regional cum￭ ulation would simplify the application of the rules of origin ￭, however it would be the more competitive countries ￭, China for example ￭, which would gain any real benefit from this ￭, not the least developed countries ￭.
It is actually difficult to deny admission to countries that do opt for the model ￭.
There is much in common we can work on ￭.
Thank you very much ￭, Commissioner Nielson ￭.
It is hardly surprising ￭, when our Prime Minister den￭ ies that a Constitution for the EU has any constitutional implications ￭, that people find it rather difficult to trust him ￭.
Furthermore ￭, I should like to remind you of the speech made by Mr Barroso in Berlin and of the speeches made by all of the group leaders within Parliament as part of the 70 cents for culture campaign ￭, all of whom promised an increase in the ‘￭ culture ￭’ budgets ￭.
It has had this role for more than 50 years ￭, since the catastrophe of the Second World War ￭.
I was in￭ und￭ ated with opinions on the common position ￭, which my government has also approved ￭.
That will focus on a closer look at how forest ￭-￭ based and related industries can ￭, for their part ￭, promote sustainable development and opti￭ mise their contribution to the protection of the environment at all stages of the production chain from forestry itself right up to the end products ￭.
After difficult negotiations ￭, the Committee on Women ￭'￭ s Rights and Equal Opport￭ unities is proposing more than 30 paragraphs of specific measures ￭, which have met with the agreement of four groups ￭.

It is clear that we are facing problems and that adjustments will have to be made ￭, but improving our safety ￭, improving traffic safety ￭, improving security in ports is a necessity and an obligation which we must fulfil ￭.
The first is to establish a new system of social security systems which offer flexible help ￭, tai￭ lo￭ red to the needs of the individual citizen and focused on assisting people through periods of unemployment rather than excluding them permanently from work ￭.
It is within this overall framework that efforts must be made to overcome the particularly odi￭ ous types of crime that are the traffic in and exploitation of human beings ￭.
Today at the meeting with Mr G￭ iscard d ￭' Estaing ￭, we must make a point of ensuring that all altern￭ ates in the Convention are given full rights of participation in the work ￭.
First ￭, we have to chart a new direction for the European Union budget to ensure that it can respond to the challenges of the 21￭ st century ￭.
We know what we are here to discuss ￭, so let us keep our temper￭ s and let us get on with the debate ￭.
In addition ￭, Kaliningrad will be discussed ￭, and on this point ￭, too ￭, significant progress was made at yesterday ￭'￭ s meeting in Luxembourg ￭, from which both Mr Verheugen and myself have just returned ￭.
I therefore call on the Commission to ensure that a serious ￭, independent impact assessment is conducted in the coming months to check for any negative effects and the consequences of the entry into force of the agreement for EU banana producers ￭.
The EU is the most important trading partner for most ACP countries ￭.
It is important now - as it was at the time - always to mobili￭ ze all our forces and energies to restore investor and consumer confidence that will bring growth and increased employment ￭.

It is true that a Member State can make use of a safeguard clause ￭.
The British people do not want it ￭.
Let us not be over ￭-￭ pres￭ crip￭ tive in direc￭ ting how Member States get there ￭.

Any restrictive set of rules is a superflu￭ ous bureaucratic obstacle ￭, in our eyes ￭.
The truth is that fiscal consolidation makes progress and improves in parallel with the increase and improvement in our growth and job creation figures ￭.
Moreover ￭, we have heard ￭, in the Committee on Agriculture and elsewhere ￭, that ￭, also in the United Kingdom - as some farmers have said - interventions are not always timely enough considering the fact that as long as three weeks have been known to pass between the occurrence of a case of foot ￭-￭ and ￭-￭ mouth disease on a farm and slaughter of the animal ￭.
After all ￭, you will decide upon the collection of data about all European citizens as well as upon the most cost ￭- and burden ￭-￭ intensive statistical exercise ￭.
Since the last enlargement of the Union - with the accession of Finland and Sweden in particular ￭, but also that of Austria - forest cover in the Union has doubled to more than 120 million hectares ￭.
Mr President ￭, the problem is quite simply that we will not have the time ￭.
Secondly ￭, you have proposed measures which will ￭, of course ￭, have immediate effects ￭, but which will also extend over the medium and long term ￭.
(￭ LT ￭) My congratulations to the rapporteur ￭.
However ￭, this increase in vis￭ itor numbers is mas￭ king an underlying trend ￭, a striking regional imbalance ￭.
Mr President ￭, these two amendments ￭, Nos 20 and 21 ￭, tabled by Mrs P￭ eij￭ s and Mr Blokland ￭, concern a technical revision aimed at equ￭ alizing the way of working out States ￭' GDP ￭, so that pre￭ judicial discrep￭ ancies in their calculation can be avoided ￭.
I think that what are needed are some more aggressive and effective initiatives in the short term ￭.
I think that would be a bad thing ￭.
But the disappointment of Florence does not end there ￭, because very little has been said on the problem of unemployment ￭, and the p￭ auc￭ ity of results from the Intergovernmental Conference is clear just from reading the conclusions published in the press ￭.
We have not yet seen any concrete proposals ￭, and that is why I should like to know ￭: what is ￭, according to the Commission ￭, the impact of the suspension of the WTO negotiations on the developments of E￭ PO￭ s ￭?
Europe ￭'￭ s cultural diversity is one of our great t￭ reas￭ ures and my group ￭, the European Free Alliance ￭, is committed to safeguarding this diversity ￭.
However ￭, this '￭ foot￭ note ￭' will not enter into force until Iceland or Croatia rati￭ fies the treaty ￭.
The Commission ￭'￭ s proposal to reduce VAT in labour ￭-￭ intensive sectors is most worthwhile ￭.
I will ￭, nevertheless ￭, pass this on to the Bureau ￭.
It is clear that the risks of error and hence mis￭ carri￭ ages of justice increase if the number of judges is reduced to only one in cases handled by the Court of First In￭ stance ￭.
Other European states are being referred to the neighbourhood policy ￭.
Any liqui￭ ds would be carried in transparent b￭ ags ￭.
Now more than ever ￭, the signs of the times advocate a more social Europe ￭.
Perhaps it is time that people acquired the same rights as the products they consume ￭.
From the institutional point of view ￭, I repeat the question ￭: why has the Council ￭, even in the pre￭ am￭ ble to its recommendations ￭, made no reference to Parliament ￭'￭ s opinions ￭?
First of all ￭, I would very much like to thank all the Members who have worked together with us on this ￭, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs ￭.
If I had to sum up my report in two lines I would say ￭, firstly ￭, the European Parliament is strongly in favour of a common policy on immigration ￭, and secondly ￭, that Parliament does not want a fragmented immigration policy any￭ more ￭.
This will help the cause of human rights and help to combat international drug trafficking ￭.
We must all work together in this effort ￭.
I would say to those who have spoken in the debate - Mr Ar￭ ron￭ i and Mrs L￭ ari￭ ve - that we should remember what the market can do ￭.
However ￭, we do not see any use in restricting the application of a judicial win￭ ding ￭-￭ up order only to companies with fraud as a primary purpose ￭.
To close ￭, I would like to refer to the question of Serbia ￭, which particularly concerns me ￭, because we have heard here from honourable Members with different views ￭.
There may be a growth rate of 2 or 2 ￭.￭ 5 % next year ￭.
This Parliament ￭, elected by citizens across the whole of Europe ￭, with parties from left to right across the political spectrum ￭, parties in government and parties in opposition ￭, will send a powerful signal if it endor￭ ses the Constitution tomorrow by an overwhelming majority ￭.
A person is then driven by biological stimul￭ i from the sub￭ cor￭ tex region of the brain that are not checked or controlled by the cor￭ tex ￭, where the higher emo￭ tions are based ￭.
However ￭, as I said earlier ￭, we have other tools besides action in the Commission on Human Rights alone and we try to find the most appropriate and most effective tool for each situation ￭.
As you know ￭, the European Union as such does not have all those resources ￭, so we need the cooperation of the Member States in making them available ￭.
That was the main point we made when the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted its opinion on the Bon￭ temp￭ i report on 21 October 1997 ￭, i ￭.￭ e ￭. nearly a year ago ￭.
Of course ￭, for a successful result it is necessary to have a consensus and in particular the good will of the Governments of Slovenia and Croatia to find a satisfying and sustainable solution ￭.
The essential problem with the Fifth Action Programme is that many of the promises set out there have not been translated into action or legislation ￭, mainly because of a lack of political will ￭.
Commissioner ￭, I would ask you - and I know that it will not be easy ￭, because resources are scar￭ ce - to put pressure on the Commission to make available the USD 3000 or 4000 million that are required ￭.
This is how people seek to divide what will soon be a Union of 25 Member States ￭.

It has finally been accepted and that is thanks to the President of the Committee of the Regions ￭, Mr Ch￭ ab￭ ert ￭, whom I had asked to send me a letter ￭.
Through this report ￭, Parliament has highlighted important issues that deserve to be emphasised in terms of the growth of European industry ￭.
All the advice I receive is that these are old studies ￭.
We already know that we will face a shortage of those drugs in the event of an outbreak ￭, and a European supply could then prove the answer ￭.
The message to our consumers would be unacceptable ￭.
Mr Liikanen ￭, you know that ￭, much as I respect you ￭, your office sometimes puts forward we￭ aris￭ ome proposals ￭.
One thing that has always been clear ￭, however ￭, is that we have a real pillar in the form of the fact that REACH has never been called into question by the industry ￭.
In each specific matter and in each small step that we must take ￭, however ￭, the solution advocating uniform￭ ity is always put forward as the most rational ￭.
We also share the principle that there is a need to improve the complete texts of amended directives ￭, as suggested in Amendment No 13 ￭.
Since you have referred to it ￭, by the way ￭, Mr D￭ alli ￭, I would like to ask you whether you already have a schedule on this matter ￭.
Everything possible must be done in 2011 to overcome these problems and to reassure the markets ￭, not superfici￭ ally but structur￭ ally ￭, in other words ￭, by creating the right conditions for growth and employment in the long term ￭.
That is what the Council was supposed to be doing ￭.
We see this happening in agriculture too ￭.
Several states believe that the D￭ PR￭ K is still legally bound by the treaty and has not followed the correct legal procedures to withdraw ￭.
Instead of removing subsidies for un￭ healthy products ￭, adher￭ ents of the internal market now want to see health turned into a commodity that can be sold freely under market conditions ￭.
In conclusion ￭, if we think ￭, like Mr Schulz ￭, that innovation is not going far enough ￭, then we should support the President of the Commission ￭, because he is trying ￭, and we should put pressure on our national leadership to support the Commission in achieving real results ￭.
It is music to my ears to hear this debate this evening ￭, because it has taken eight years to get this far ￭, with the help of Hu￭ mane Society International ￭.
We talk about loop￭ holes in the legislation ￭.
After perhaps a low start ￭, preparations seem to be gathering pace and no doubt it is imperative that consumers and operators keep tight control of the process ￭.
The principle of legal certainty is particularly important for small and medium ￭-￭ sized businesses ￭.
However ￭, they are also needed in order to compensate for the increasing shortcomings of national health services as the result of public ￭-￭ sector management ￭, high costs and cut￭ backs in expenditure by governments ￭, expenditure which has steadily decreased in all the Member States during the 1980￭ s and at the beginning of the 1990￭ s ￭.
This is an important issue - it has already been mentioned twice this morning ￭.
The previous extradition system was cum￭ ber￭ some and no longer fit for purpose in the modern world of open borders and serious and organised cross ￭-￭ border crimes ￭.

At the same time ￭, the EU will import 70 ￭% of its energy in 2030 ￭, compared with 50 ￭% today ￭.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions ￭:
You have said that we want faster spending because far too much remains un￭ spent at the moment ￭.

on behalf of the PPE ￭-￭ DE Group ￭. - (￭ PL ￭) Mr President ￭, the Special Court for Sierra Leone is entitled to count on our particular attention ￭, as it is rightly presented as a new and almost perfect model for the pursuit of justice ￭.
4 ￭% of annual GDP and this money is not being used adequately ￭.
That rule would have disastrous results as it would put an end to the only serious bra￭ ke on the Commission ￭'￭ s feder￭ alist activis￭ m ￭.
- (￭ CS ￭) Mr President ￭, Commissioner ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, I am concerned about the suffering of laboratory animals as well ￭, but at the same time I know ￭, as a physician ￭, that we must do everything we can to make vaccines and medicines available to our patients as soon as possible ￭, for the treatment of new and old diseases ￭.
This European Council was over￭ shad￭ owed by the so ￭-￭ called mad ￭-￭ cow crisis ￭. The mad cows actually res￭ cu￭ ed the summit because it was possible to claim that it was a success just because the boycott threatened by one Member State or its prime minister was avoided ￭, apparently firmly ￭.
They are also graded ￭, which is an important aspect ￭.
With more than 90 ￭% of AIDS patients in developing countries ￭, we want Europe to un￭ ambigu￭ ously decide which side it is on and to strictly limit itself to a solution in line with the political Doha agreement ￭.
I would therefore like to express my thanks for this directive ￭, which deserves our full support ￭.
I can give you a specific example of this ￭.
It is now up to the Commission and our governments to take steps to ensure that crime is fought effectively ￭.
Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to address your House on the subject of how our Union is to be funded in future ￭, and on the interinstitutional agreement ￭.
Another person ￭, who is totally handic￭ apped ￭, said that they wanted to go to London but that they could not do so because they would have lost their pension ￭.
I am ￭, furthermore ￭, surprised that the Commission is fur￭ ther￭ ing privatisation as a means to fight corruption ￭.
I would remind you that at the time the Commission officially published a statement st￭ ressing that the Council ￭'￭ s position was a real step backwards in terms of the aims of the S￭ LI￭ M initiative to simplify the legislation of the internal market ￭.
N￭ ow￭ adays ￭, there are many workers who are sent on short ￭-￭ term contracts to work in other Member States and who do not receive any right of residence at all ￭.
However ￭, these are exceptional circumstances ￭.
It is now generally acknowledged that taking notice of the issue of disability is the key to resolving it ￭.
The tax policy issues you are currently discussing have a major role in order to achieve the Commission ￭'￭ s objective to better tackle tax fraud and ev￭ asion which results in the loss of EUR 200 billion to EUR 250 billion a year at EU level ￭.
Mr President ￭, the Fifth Environmental Action Programme forms the basis of the European Union ￭'￭ s present environment policy ￭.
They hope we will help them to find a solution to the very difficult political situation into which politicians have led their country ￭.
Nor could we do that ￭.

We have a responsibility to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world ￭, a responsibility to live up to the UN ￭'￭ s Millennium Development Goals ￭.

The regulation of chemicals within the EU must give proper protection to workers ￭, consumers and the environment while ￭, at the same time ￭, being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of European industry and thereby ensuring jobs ￭.
It is clear that having protagon￭ ists who genuinely demonstrate that we are capable of organising ourselves is a fundamental element of European construction ￭.
(￭ PT ￭) As we know ￭, this is an area of potential conflict between fundamental rights ￭, respect for fundamental rights ￭, and security ￭.
Member of the Commission ￭. - (￭ FR ￭) Mr President ￭, honourable Members ￭, once again I will be very quick ￭.
We simply had to reiterate the agreements reached in the debate and the adoption of Directive 2005 ￭/￭ 35 ￭/￭ EC and of Council Framework Decision 2005 ￭/￭ 6￭ 67 ￭/￭ J￭ HA ￭, but according to the new legal basis ￭, since the aforementioned rul￭ ings bring about the possibility that the Community legislator may adopt measures relating to the criminal law of Member States ￭.
It is also a scandal that the EU budget should be used to support bul￭ l￭ fighting ￭, which is a tradition I do not consider to be compatible with modern values and animal rights ￭.
A Commissioner who fails to priori￭ tise the European interest but represents his own national interests is a corrupt Commissioner who must be brought down ￭.
Moreover ￭, we have ￭, I hope ￭, arrived at unanimous conclusions on genetically modified organisms ￭.
A number of consumer protection directives ￭, such as Directive 97 ￭/￭ 7 ￭/￭ EC on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts ￭, applies to consumer contracts concluded by electronic means and ￭, indeed ￭, the e ￭-￭ commerce Directive clearly states that it is without prejudice to the level of protection for consumer interests as established by Community acts ￭, including the consumer acquis ￭.
We ￭, that is ￭, Mr Romano Prodi ￭, Mr Javier Solana and myself ￭, are considering a date when we could undertake this important mission ￭. Pos￭ si￭ bly the third week of November ￭.
I have heard that some in the Commission believe that they have managed to squ￭ ee￭ ze more out of Member States in the past six months than they had in the previous six years ￭.
Progress is thus being made in the re￭ balancing of the Union ￭'￭ s policies to make it possible to deal with our relations with our neighbours in Central and Eastern Europe and in a similar manner with our neighbours on the southern fl￭ ank of Europe ￭.
in writing ￭. (￭ PL ￭) I am voting in favour of the recommendation of a common position of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (￭ EC ￭) No 23￭ 20 ￭/￭ 2002 ￭.
In other words ￭, if the European Parliament adopts this amendment ￭, the directive will fail ￭, and we will not have it ￭.
While we will be supporting some amendments against him tomorrow ￭, it will not be at the cost of backing the general project ￭.
The accession of ten countries in 2004 will increase the agricultural area by 29 ￭% and the number of agricultural holdings by 74 ￭% ￭.
The euro area has been an area of stability and job creation ￭.
Like you ￭, I would prefer the earliest possible agreement ￭, ide￭ ally before the elections ￭.

Thus ￭, the Member States or employers acting alone can say that eight in￭ active working hours implies 0 ￭.￭ 8 hours active time ￭.
The Moroccan authorities have been using excessive violence ￭.
I welcome the development that the Commission under￭ takes to report on the concrete follow ￭-￭ up given to any legislative initiative requests within three months of its adoption ￭; the Commission shall come forward with a legislative proposal after one year at the latest or include the proposal in the next year ￭'￭ s work programme ￭.
I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission would present an initiative and a strategy on this matter ￭.
In any case ￭, this Convention has been quoted as an example that can point the way forward for other European texts ￭.
I voted for the motion because I feel that relations should be closer ￭.
The text is ￭, ad￭ mittedly ￭, a first step in the right direction since hedge funds were not previously obliged to be transparent ￭.
The budgetary savings proposed mean it would no longer be possible to compensate aids to beef farmers ￭, but would make it possible to save 2 ￭.￭ 4 billion ECU from the farming budget (￭ cf ￭. Stur￭ dy report on prices package ￭) ￭.
Prec￭ isely because it is not yet being applied throughout the processing sector ￭, and because this system has been designed solely for industry ￭, it should not be extended to the primary sector just yet ￭.
Members are entitled to invo￭ ke the Rules and insist that the President suspend the sitting in the event that not all the facilities are available ￭.
Good examples certainly serve to encourage others to follow them ￭.
My intention in proposing this extension is to avoid opening complex discussions on technical measures in the way of our reform ￭.
They need to have the tools to make these choices ￭.
An example of this is what is known as ‘￭ Operation Mir￭ acle ￭’ ￭, as a result of which ￭, and with resources provided mainly by Venezuela ￭, more than 208 000 blind Latin Americans and Cari￭ b￭ be￭ ans had their sight restored in 2005 following free operations in Cuba ￭.
The Commissioner has confirmed as much ￭.
This is why ￭, as rapporteur ￭, I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy ￭, Transport and Tourism for helping me to complete this task ￭, and also everyone within Parliament and outside ￭, professionals and associations ￭, who have helped me to look in detail into these questions and gain a better grasp of the issues at stake ￭.

Two minutes is very short and the list of tasks is a long one ￭.

I suspect it was because what Commissioner Barnier said in recomm￭ ending them - they had been chosen '￭ because of their commitment to Europe ￭' ￭.
I want to thank those colleagues from Parliament who met representatives and British farmers and listened to that comp￭ elling case ￭.
It is therefore in this frame of mind that I have come to meet you here this afternoon ￭, and it is in this frame of mind that I will continue my work ￭.
In this area ￭, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action ￭: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti ￭-￭ competitive practices ￭, by re￭ focusing its departments ￭' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manif￭ est Community interest and by affir￭ ming its intention to modernise competition law ￭.
The parties should ￭, moreover ￭, actively strive to achieve the objectives laid down by the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils ￭, particularly those affecting women directly ￭: an employment rate among women of at least 60 ￭% by no later than 2010 ￭, together with regulations concerning access to good child￭ care at a reasonable cost ￭.
Mr López Garri￭ do ￭, Mrs Malmström ￭, in my opinion ￭, any agreement will only be acceptable if guarantees of a suitable level of data protection are given ￭, respecting the principles of necessity and proportionality and the EU rules in force ￭.

Mr President ￭, Commissioner ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, the European packaging directive has had a considerable impact ￭.
The new European strategy ￭, inspired by the guidelines of the Monti report ￭, has the merit of indicating concrete measures for getting out of this period of economic crisis by restoring productivity and employment levels ￭.
I wish to join in thanking the rapporteurs ￭, Mrs Sche￭ ele and Mrs Pol￭ i Bor￭ tone ￭, the shadow rapporteurs ￭, the Commission and the Council for the work they have done on ensuring that ￭, tomorrow ￭, we have an agreement on which to adopt a position and that will make it much simpler for consumers to make health￭ ier choices ￭, because they have access to more accurate and more comprehensive information ￭.
So ￭, thanks to you all ￭, from whatever parties ￭, who have really been working for culture to become important and culture to be able to speak to the people ￭.

From this v￭ ant￭ age point ￭, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy ￭.
The amount was brought down by the amendment to EUR 7 ￭.￭ 35 billion for the seven ￭-￭ year period ￭, so actually the money you spoke of before was not made available by this report ￭.

Nonetheless a great deal of the programmes that are within our remit would be significantly affected by the spending proposals for the Balkans ￭, unless Mrs Haug is successful ￭.

It is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed ￭, and rightly so ￭.
The European Union has always champi￭ oned the free movement of people internationally ￭.
After the last conference on this subject ￭, I left in a frame of mind that was anything but optimistic ￭, but I am hear￭ tened by the fact that an amendment concerning the need for a quality label for hor￭ ticul￭ tural products ￭, tabled by the ALDE Group ￭, was adopted unanimously in the Agricultural Group by all parties ￭.

Mr Ras￭ mus￭ sen laid into Angela Merkel ￭.
The second issue is the clear conflict here between the Parliament and the Council ￭.

Mr President ￭, REACH ￭, one of the most complex legislative procedures – and not just because it runs to 1 200 pages – kept ten of this House ￭’￭ s committees occupied ￭, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ￭, whose opinion I have drafted ￭, was one of them ￭.

At the same time as '￭ basic EU law ￭' is expanding ￭, the currency union ￭, the EMU ￭, is also coming into force ￭.

Anyone who ￭, like me ￭, re￭ members being told that the sea is our future ￭, that it is a source of unlimited food ￭, that everything is available to us ￭, and who now ￭, just a few years later ￭, reads what Mr T￭ ever￭ son has said ￭, will see a tragic picture emerging ￭.
The questions are deliberately open ￭.

Therefore ￭, I would expect that the Commission ￭, by one means or another ￭, to be able to transfer and agree to the top￭ ping ￭-￭ up appropriations which might be necessary as far as our external policy is concerned ￭.
Within its framework thousands upon thousands of Europe ￭'￭ s young people have been able to study abroad ￭, gain knowledge and stimulation ￭, and have their image of the world en￭ ric￭ hed through actual international experience ￭.

Ju￭ dging by what was said in Parliament this morning in reply to the last President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office ￭, Prime Minister John Bru￭ ton ￭, one can see that the emphasis is on a Europe which is closer to the people ￭, which can take account of the people ￭'￭ s concerns ￭, can react quickly and assu￭ age fears but which ￭, at the same time ￭, can sti￭ r enthusiasm and passion in people ￭.

A debate on the second package is due to take place tomorrow ￭.
Every￭ where you look employees rights are under threat ￭.
I am concerned about Mr Mulder ￭'￭ s Amendments Nos 1 to 4 ￭, based on budgetary control ￭, when the my￭ th of fraud in the COM is quite important in absolute and relative terms ￭.
That decision was a gesture of confidence on the part of the European Parliament in the will and the ability of the Turkish authorities to manage the hunger strike crisis in a non ￭-￭ violent ￭, humane and efficient manner ￭.
For my own group ￭, our priority is to complete the single market ￭, especially in the area of financial services ￭.
Just as too much taxation k￭ ills taxes ￭, as Jacques Chirac was once fond of saying ￭, in an electoral period it is true ￭, too much fishing k￭ ills fish and if we are forced to reduce net mesh sizes ￭, we shall end up cat￭ ching nothing but plan￭ k￭ ton ￭.
As the EU and the European Parliament ￭'￭ s very foundations are based on shared values ￭, of which non ￭-￭ discrimination is a key element ￭, then it is our duty to voice concern where we see these values being violated and these rights denied to others in third countries ￭.
There are a lot of subjects that clu￭ tter our agendas and prevent us from devo￭ ting enough time to the really important issues ￭.
poor working conditions for people working in the Members ￭' cash office
In acc￭ eding to the WTO ￭, China is continuing this process ￭.
We still need to develop a rural development policy which is another important dimension of a balanced future CAP which can actually respond to the needs of all European agriculture systems and not just some of them ￭.
The Commission does not de￭ em these practices illegal if they have a legitimate basis in national law for social ￭, educational ￭, cultural or other reasons ￭.
You see ￭, words channel the way people think ￭.
It is for that reason that I voted against this report ￭.
Mr President ￭, most of the previous speakers have demonstrated that the way this matter is being handled is un￭ professional ￭, betr￭ ays an irresponsible attitude towards market participants – both businesses and their customers – and makes for more uncertainty than clarity ￭.
However ￭, the Council has not supported us in our proposal for a significant increase in the initial financial framework of the programme ￭.
Are these aff￭ lic￭ tions of the past ￭, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations ￭?
The effectiveness of the law ￭, especially within the Community area ￭, will lie in this prec￭ ision and in its capacity to provide a realistic response to practical problems ￭.
Since the first oil crisis ￭, the problem of unemployment has been near the top ￭, if not the first item ￭, on our governments ￭' agendas ￭.
I am in any case grateful for your understanding ￭.
The discussion that we are having today is crucial ￭, but this is the wrong answer ￭.
This is a contradiction ￭.
The Union has to be prepared to finance this cooperation between neighbouring regions ￭.
The Member States had to adopt the measures necessary to comply with this framework decision before 27 January 2005 ￭.
However ￭, we continue to lag behind our most important international competitors in terms of our investment in ￭, or the priority attached to ￭, innovation ￭.
As a result ￭, there should ￭, not least ￭, be a deepening of democracy in the European Union and improved participation by European citizens ￭.
In particular ￭, the European Parliament ￭, a specialised assembly ￭, may be of use in carrying out specialised tasks ￭, but never in the general exercise of sovereignty ￭.
Its action was always embedded in the fundamental sense of the existence of the European Union ￭, the solidarity of everyone in the general European interest ￭.
Others have been able to overcome their pre￭ judices and reservations ￭; we should pay tribute to Germany and the courageous vote of the Bundes￭ tag ￭.
In this context ￭, I would remind the Commission and the Council that any cooperation between the European Union and Iran needs to start from the pre￭ mise that respect for human rights is an absolute must ￭.
We hope it will result in more resources for promoting the European Union ￭’￭ s activities in the field of disarmament and the non ￭-￭ proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the period 2007 ￭-￭ 2013 ￭.
Madam President ￭, Europe is rightly regarded as having the saf￭ est medicines in the world ￭.
President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office ￭. - (￭ SL ￭) The only response I can make to Mr H￭ igg￭ ins is that I cannot answer his question because the answer lies within the competence of the European Commission ￭.
In practical terms ￭, the conclusions show that ￭, while attention has been focused on improving long ￭-￭ term competitiveness ￭, the objectives of improving the environment ￭, enhancing quality of life and promoting coordination and communication have not been implemented strongly enough ￭.
EU legislators have brought to light the consistently great pressure they exert ￭.
Meanwhile ￭, the Commission will also have discussions on these issues within the group of Commission Members who work on consumer health matters ￭.
Another thing we need to address is the danger of "￭ computer dependence ￭” ￭.
On Monday ￭, the Employment ￭, Social Policy ￭, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (￭ EP￭ S￭ CO ￭) adopted this comprehensive ￭, global approach in the fight against gender violence ￭; in other words ￭, '￭ zero tolerance ￭' ￭.
Quite apart from the need to respect human dignity ￭, I believe that it is also essential to show respect for the European Parliament and its role ￭, which must not be either passive or un￭ productive ￭.
A European statute of association must not be viewed unilaterally as a business association ￭, but it must also be compatible with char￭ itable associations and the issues of subsidiarity ￭, the freedom to form articles of association and the freedom of citizens and association ￭.
As a Member of the European Parliament ￭, where we have so often voted on Schengen ￭, I believe that ￭, although there is legislation for the free movement of people ￭, the fact that ￭, in reality ￭, this legislation is being systematically violated by the German authorities is an insul￭ t to ￭, and undermines ￭, our work ￭.
I would argue that European agriculture has a major role to play ￭, not only ensuring that we are self ￭-￭ sufficient here ￭, but also ensuring that we can contribute to global food security in the future ￭.
I strongly believe that we are here to represent the European citizens and we have to be clear that we are capable of sending a very strong message for all of us ￭.
In the June List ￭'￭ s opinion ￭, this is entirely unacceptable ￭.
This proposal is the only way to restore the confidence of small sav￭ ers and to stabilise the market for banking services ￭.
Finally ￭, I should mention the Seventh Research Framework Programme ￭, which runs parallel to new strategy ￭.
On the contrary ￭, it must step up its action and boost its resources ￭, targeting them at prevention and assistance for welfare and health bodies ￭, the rehabilitation of drug ad￭ dic￭ ts ￭, exchanges of information between Member States and the harmonisation of statistical and scientific reporting systems ￭.
Mr President ￭, the speed at which the European Union has taken certain decisions is a perfect illustration of what up ti￭ ll now has been Community inaction in the field of maritime safety ￭.
I have Decision No E 05 ￭/￭ 98 of 8 July of the Constitutional Court of Togo ￭, which confirms what I myself observed and explained as early as Monday ￭, 22 June in a communiqué ￭.
Mrs Thy￭ ssen ￭, we have examined the matter ￭.
On the other hand ￭, I think that it is a matter of some concern that 80 % of these 131 cases had to be dismissed because they did not relate to matters falling within the Ombudsman ￭'￭ s terms of reference ￭.
The Commission ￭'￭ s proposal aims to give the European Parliament and the Council equal rights as co ￭-￭ legislators in controlling the Commission ￭; but the proposal cannot go further than or beyond the scope of the present Treaty ￭, which does not provide for explicit delegation of legislative power to the Commission ￭.
As I stated in my presentation ￭, I believe that the automatic stabilis￭ ers are sufficient in practically all cases ￭, but it is essential that a position of surplus balance is reached first ￭, so that these mechanisms can be fully effective ￭.
Ap￭ prov￭ al of these measures in the course of the Italian Presidency will help to improve the Union ￭'￭ s economic and social outlook ￭.
To whom should I turn for information ￭?
We are therefore disappointed that other no￭ ises are often to be heard from this Parliament ￭. In particular ￭, no￭ ises are occasionally heard from the right side of the House to the effect that Europe should remain a Christian club where Muslims are not welcome ￭.
I voted in favour of the report on GDP and beyond - Meas￭ uring progress in a changing world ￭, for the following reasons ￭.
This directive will provide the basis for a Europe without road offences ￭, without borders and without any chance of breaking the rules ￭.

But ￭, having worked at home and raised a large family ￭, I know the important part I played in the development of my children ￭.
Neither the national parliaments nor us ￭!
What are the options open to citizens looking to fight these abuses ￭?
in writing ￭. - (￭ PT ￭) We are confronted by a humanitarian drama in which families are not only suffering the pain of their relatives being missing ￭, but have also had to live for decades with the ag￭ ony of not knowing their fate ￭.
Madam President ￭, I am not going to repeat what Mr Lin￭ ko￭ hr and Mrs Mc￭ N￭ ally have explained so well to us ￭.
This arrangement would enable us to prevent destructive tri￭ angular trade while ensuring for the least developed countries that their local populations working in the sugar ￭-￭ producing sector will actually benefit from the preferential trade regime with the European Union ￭.
In some Member States ￭, consumer safeguards are very good ￭.
We must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the Member States of the Union ￭.
No ￭.
Report (￭ A ￭5 ￭-￭ 00￭ 11 ￭/￭ 2000 ￭) by Mr Langen ￭, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee ￭, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Al￭ ten￭ er (￭ C ￭5 ￭-￭ 03￭ 33 ￭/￭ 1999 - 1997 ￭/￭ 03￭ 70 ￭(￭ COD ￭) ￭)
He calls for the role of the social partners concerned ￭, and dialogue with them ￭, to be reinforced in the fr￭ aming of legislation ￭.
It should be recalled that the Commission ￭’￭ s original proposals completely ignored the unique and vital nature of the services in question and their relationship with the exercise of Member States ￭’ public powers ￭.
I would also like to echo the words of Mr Mulder when he spoke of the importance of the procedure for granting discharge and stressed that it must be taken extremely seriously ￭.
It is high time that the issue of European Union citizens ￭' pensions was dealt with properly ￭.
The Commission should refuse to go along with the current proposals of ECOFIN ￭, whereby the Commission might give a helping hand to the presidency of the euro ￭-￭ 11 ￭.
EU economic and trade relations with Mercosur (￭ debate ￭)
Parliament has on several occasions requested us to suspend the association agreement ￭.
The question is the more important ￭, Mr President ￭, as it does not only concern relations between the Commission and this Parliament ￭.
Finally ￭, I would like to say that the fact that women are socially disadvantaged and that discrimination against the indigenous peoples continues ￭, to highlight just two of the problem areas ￭, is in violation of universal human rights ￭.
Str￭ ong feelings have also been ar￭ ous￭ ed over the question whether President Ber￭ ish￭ a should continue in office ￭.
It has called on the parties of the Greek parliament ￭, but it has not called on the parties in the European Parliament ￭.
He is threatened with six months imprisonment ￭. So this possibility is very real ￭.
Last but not least ￭, I would also like ￭, once again ￭, to come back to the issue of market supervision ￭, as the best directives are only worth as much as their market supervision ￭, which ultimately ensures the monitoring of compliance with the directives ￭, and of course ￭, to the tariff issue ￭.
The postal service that thinks that it can be monopolis￭ tic has not been so for a long time ￭.
The EU ￭’￭ s responsibility in this respect is crus￭ hing ￭.
. Mr President ￭, Commissioner ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets I would like to say that the Lisbon objectives must remain the priority of the Union ￭’￭ s economic and social policies ￭, especially on the eve of enlargement ￭, and that it is therefore essential that the Member States make available to the European Union ￭’￭ s budget the resources necessary for achieving those objectives ￭.
I stand by my opinion that the Commission ￭'￭ s answer is a study in arrogance ￭, whereas ￭, by contrast ￭, I am delighted with the much more constructive response from the Council ￭.
Formation of political groups (￭ amendment of Rule 29 ￭) (
You will see from the resolution that we have also called upon Member States in particular to declare their support for it and to put the necessary resources behind that very important project ￭.
I welcome Mr Fal￭ con￭ er ￭'￭ s suggestion that it be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure ￭, the V￭ eri￭ fication of Cre￭ denti￭ als and Imm￭ unities for amendment ￭.
It is a prof￭ oundly unfair measure ￭, and that is why we have voted against it ￭.
Having failed to deal with the root cause of the disease in 1990 ￭, which is what Jacques Delors and his gang refused to do so as not to inter￭ rupt the trium￭ ph￭ ant march ￭, firstly towards the single market and then towards the euro ￭, we have since adopted numerous financial and technical stop ￭-￭ gap measures to ward off the never ￭-￭ ending effects of what has been a disaster in health ￭, trade and financial terms ￭.
In addition ￭, investments in improving energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources will create millions of jobs and will contribute towards growth in the EU ￭; at the same time ￭, they will also help to cut the money currently wasted on maintaining energy ￭-￭ intensive buildings ￭.
As you know ￭, this idea was launched here in Parliament three years ago ￭, but there is still a long way to go and we still have to wait for this dream to come true ￭.
They would rather have assistance in building up their local shipyards and fishing fleets ￭. That is what we must help them with ￭.
In this way ￭, we could re ￭-￭ establish a balance so as to make re￭ locations to third countries less attractive for our companies ￭.
As a result ￭, safety procedures have been improved ￭.
We want to have five years instead of seven and an adjustment to the period so that the new Parliament and a new Commission can have real influence over the framework that is to apply during their term of office ￭.
That is why we tried to do the same in the case of Spain ￭, but that does not ￭, of course ￭, mean that we want to shir￭ k our duty to take a decision ￭.
The Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research ￭, technological development and demonstration activities (￭ FP ￭7 ￭) is the largest research support instrument in the world and represents the primary tool of European Union research policy ￭.
In conclusion ￭, I would suggest that simply tin￭ k￭ ering around the ed￭ ges of the problem will not end the inherent cru￭ el￭ ty in long ￭-￭ distance live transports ￭.
I believe that the essential elements to avoid defl￭ ection of trade are included in the proposal ￭.
It is what is practical today ￭, though ￭, and for that reason we must support the Commission on this point ￭.
The Commission appreci￭ ates the un￭ failing support it receives from Parliament ￭.
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together ￭, of innovation ￭, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and toler￭ ating each other ￭.
This solution does not serve the objectives of harmoni￭ ous development of the national territory as a whole ￭.
Let me here list three conditions ￭.
I am pleased with the fact that non ￭-￭ food products ￭, in addition to food products ￭, are now being taken into consideration ￭.
That is a wonderful cat￭ ch￭ word ￭.
The stronger the Union institutions are ￭, the more firmly they must be ancho￭ red in democracy ￭.
Timor ￭, M￭ olu￭ c￭ cas ￭, Ac￭ eh ￭, Pap￭ ua and now Bor￭ neo ￭-￭ K￭ alim￭ ant￭ an all show this ￭.
- (￭ DE ￭) Mr President ￭, the large majority of people in the European Union ￭, probably the majority of governments in the European Union ￭, and almost certainly the majority in this House ￭, hoped in November that Barack Obama would be elected president ￭.
Obviously ￭, sh￭ op￭ ke￭ e￭ pers are unable to identify potential for￭ g￭ eries which are worth ￭, if you will for￭ give me for saying so ￭, more than 3 500 of our poor old francs ￭, in other words ￭, half the minimum wage in France ￭.
The Council emphasized that this 1 billion had to be transferred again from 1998 to 1999 in order to achieve the zero growth rate of the 1998 budget ￭.
If these areas are to be transferred largely or wholly to Brussels ￭, we ought at least to have the cour￭ tes￭ y to consult our constituents first ￭.
Since then ￭, the situation has not changed and increases in the volume of traffic make it even more critical ￭, almost unsustainable ￭, due to the continu￭ al delays that are building up and also affecting the ad￭ joining French section of the line ￭.
As a matter of fact ￭, unlike many of the strategies that you have provided before ￭, Mr Barroso – I would call them ‘￭ nat￭ o ￭’ ￭: no action talk only – this one has a lot of action ￭.
Of course there are sectors of the business world ￭, including the new media ￭, in which we occupy leading positions ￭.
The European Parliament will then prepare to play an effective role in enforc￭ ing the necessary measures ￭.
Mr President ￭, firstly I wish to thank Mrs Thy￭ ssen for her gesture and for her defence of the amendment we are presenting ￭.
We talked about the conditions under which politics was conducted in Europe ￭'￭ s poorest country ￭, Moldova ￭.

On E￭ aster Saturday 1997 I had the pleasure of visiting the European Hospital in Gaza on the very last day before the work￭ men finally left - a hospital that has been under construction since 1990 ￭.
The other is to tax speculative capital movements and financial transactions ￭. That would generate considerable revenue for the European economy and I believe that it would be a weapon against the financial crisis that we are currently experiencing ￭.
Mr President ￭, I would ask for a revision to be made of the translations in the different language versions ￭, in particular the German version ￭, where I have noted that certain translations could give rise to mis￭ understand￭ ings ￭.
Obviously ￭, as I myself will be the President of the sitting then ￭, I will not oppose it ￭.
(￭ The speaker stops ￭)
There is therefore no problem ￭.
It does not take much imagination to understand the hop￭ el￭ ess￭ ness ￭, the fear of the future and the financial worries they go through ￭, day after day ￭.
Forest ar￭ son endang￭ ers human lives and the natural wealth of a region ￭.
So we are not exactly on the same page ￭, but I look forward to listening to the comments of the Hon￭ ourable Members ￭.
I am also pleased that fathers will be encouraged to care for their children by introducing a two ￭-￭ week patern￭ ity leave ￭.
The proposal to abolish the prior fixing of freight rates – which is the principal effect of conferences – is sensible and therefore to be welcomed ￭.
As we have seen in other countries such as Zimbabwe ￭, quiet diplomacy does not work ￭.
If we await the comprehensive monitoring report six months before enlargement ￭, the Commission may have no alternative but to impose safeguards since the nuclear option of susp￭ ending enlargement may not be viable ￭.
One condition of adequate administration ￭, however ￭, is that the division of labour and of responsibility of both Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee be clarified both inter￭ institu￭ tionally and with regard to the individuals involved ￭.
Otherwise ￭, the programme will be not accepted and it will also fail for economic reasons ￭.
Finally ￭, I should like to thank Mr Pet￭ tin￭ ari for an excellent report ￭.
The common concern of us all is ￭, without any ifs and buts ￭, the maximum possible safety of our food ￭, which ￭, though ￭, should also look good and taste good ￭.
Some forecast that we will vote against the Treaty of Nice ￭, a perfectly legitimate action ￭, I feel ￭.
This partnership ￭, which needs to cover both economic and political matters ￭, is one of the key requirements for a peace and stability policy in the twenty ￭-￭ first century ￭.
My second question concerns the following matter ￭. Some weeks ago ￭, you were evid￭ ently mis￭ quoted in the German ￭-￭ speaking media ￭, wh￭ er￭ eu￭ p￭ on your press service put out a statement correc￭ ting matters ￭.
I believe it to be unacceptable that the Council has once again failed to wait for the European Parliament ￭’￭ s opinion ￭, and that it refused to inform the Committee on Civil Liberties ￭, Justice and Home Affairs of progress made in its own negotiations when the parliamentary committee was discussing the very same issue ￭.
You are a very good or￭ ator ￭, Mr Sarkozy ￭, but I am not so sure that you are that good a lis￭ ten￭ er ￭.
Mr President ￭, I have two points to make ￭.
The first three ￭-￭ year scheme was implemented from 2006 to 2008 ￭.
Mrs G￭ á￭ l has our wholehear￭ ted backing in the work she has done and is doing ￭; the preparatory steps she has taken in this area are good and important ￭.
But the com￭ for￭ ting phrase I wanted to ut￭ ter is that this Commissioner is responsible within the Commission for the relations with Switzerland ￭.
I cannot accept the '￭ principle of budgetary neutrality ￭' either ￭, which means that the spending levels proposed for the future will be less than at the start of the programme in the early 1990￭ s (￭ still without the article in the Treaty on European Union ￭) ￭;
It also shows the very important European cre￭ denti￭ als of Slovenia ￭.
Nor does it create any burdens for the European distribution system which ￭, indirectly ￭, without cos￭ ting the public finances anything ￭, fav￭ ours the return to Europe of significant production ￭, slow￭ s business relocation and also contributes to the fight against counterfeiting ￭.
In the discussion on minimum reserves over the past few months ￭, three key functions of this instrument have taken shape ￭.
The Commission ￭'￭ s proposal will be cou￭ ched in those terms ￭.
I support Slovakia ￭'￭ s emergency demand to the Commission to re￭ open their closed Bo￭ hun￭ ice re￭ actor ￭, which will also help to address climate change ￭.
I congratulate Mr Goebbels for tackling a number of them ￭.
In think decisions concerning energy policy should be taken at national level ￭.
Swit￭ ching to digital technology leads to a surplus in what has ti￭ ll now been a scar￭ city in frequencies available ￭.
Secondly ￭, paragraph 22 ￭, which Mr Seg￭ uro just mentioned ￭.
However ￭, it is truly convinced that in their actions the governments of Member States will always be guided by the basic principles mentioned above ￭, principles without which the Community would have no future ￭.
I can only draw the conclusion that the male candidate was appointed on a quota basis ￭.
Women who have the where￭ with￭ al to pay can have these operations in Portuguese private hospitals dis￭ gu￭ ised as other kinds of surgery ￭.
In some cases ￭, restructuring is badly handled ￭. This leads to job losses ￭, and the region in question is hit hard ￭.
The number of couples for whom fertilis￭ ation by this method is their only chance of having off￭ spring is growing year on year ￭.
Over this period ￭, some national central banks have feared radical resi￭ zing with subsequent centr￭ alisation of power in Frankfurt ￭.
– Mr President ￭, Commissioner ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, I should like to start by saying a word of thanks to Mrs Kre￭ hl for her sound report and excellent cooperation on this issue ￭.
(￭ FR ￭) Mr President ￭, I would just like to add a word to what Mr Lib￭ ick￭ i said ￭: the Group of the European People ￭'￭ s Party (￭ Christian Democrats ￭) and European Democrats ￭'￭ s motion was not the result of a compromise ￭.
Nami￭ bia must be reminded of its international obligations ￭, which signi￭ fy that human rights apply to everyone and are universal and indi￭ visible ￭.
At the same time we see the entire history of the 20￭ th century ￭.
Our resolution does not reflect the fact that in Pes￭ ha￭ war today there is an enormous meeting taking place of those seeking - including the moderate Taliban - the restoration of democracy in that country ￭.
We are therefore relying on the Commission to create a legal framework as soon as possible in order to put a stop to this ￭.
The progress made in developing an effective decentralised system for contracts and financial management systems for EU assistance as foreseen in the CAR￭ DS multiannual programme for 2005 ￭-￭ 06 for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia needs to be examined further ￭.
If this is successfully achieved ￭, then the S￭ FOR force should stay ￭, because if refugees are starting to return to the area ￭, then we will need a S￭ FOR which tries to bridge the gap between military and civil aspects ￭, and which is able to act during ri￭ ots and to make ar￭ rests ￭, if necessary ￭.
Similarly ￭, we need localisation of content production ￭, which is a means of adapting products according to linguistic and cultural needs and the li￭ king of consumers ￭.
Our agriculture is firstly intended to provide - to guarantee - food security for 450 million Europeans ￭, but we must also take our place on solvent markets ￭.
Ac￭ cid￭ ent victims often suffer twice over ￭, first as a result of the accident itself and then because they are un￭ familiar with the law of the country where the accident took place ￭.
We must avoid trying for a sect￭ orial harmonization of the social conditions in the electricity industry ￭.
Finally ￭, our group supports the report by Mr J￭ ov￭ é Per￭ es ￭.
As for subsidis￭ ed job schemes ￭, not only have they been completely in￭ effectu￭ al in combating unemployment ￭, the money has generally gone straight into the employers ￭' po￭ ckets and workers have been replaced by the subsidis￭ ed unemployed ￭, resulting in constant infringements of collective agreements ￭.
For the first time in the history of the European Union ￭.
We have yet again a further example of the lu￭ dic￭ r￭ ous mis￭ management of the affairs of this Chamber ￭.
Due to limited time ￭, I shall comment on just a few of them ￭:
Lastly ￭, since the revision of the European Commission directive limits coverage to depos￭ itors who are natural persons ￭, I think it would be appropriate to extend this slightly to cover small and medium ￭-￭ sized enterprises ￭; they are actively involved in the production processes of the EU economy and represent irre￭ plac￭ eable human and social assets ￭.
On this basis I abstained ￭.
I am not doing it only because he is standing next to me and k￭ ic￭ king me in the ank￭ le ￭, but because I think his report is very good indeed ￭.
The desire from an environmental perspective for a wholly mandatory regime must fit well with market considerations and be industry ￭-￭ friendly ￭.
