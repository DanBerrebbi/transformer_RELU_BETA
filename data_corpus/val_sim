The Eurosystem has assumed responsibility for the single monetary policy at a time when inflation rates are compatible with price stability and when prospects for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area are favourable .

The tasks of the Eurosystem to promote the smooth functioning of payment systems and to contribute to the smooth conduct of national policies in the field of prudential supervision and financial stability give the ECB an even stronger incentive to monitor and assess relevant developments in securities market infrastructures and the regulatory framework .
Indeed , the efficient clearing and settlement of securities transactions is crucial to the orderly functioning of securities markets , the smooth conduct of monetary policy operations and the stability of the financial system as a whole . Because of the systemic importance of operators offering such services and the complex technical and public policy considerations involved , the regulation of these distinct types of market functions should be addressed separately .
The smooth working of both payment systems and securities settlement systems is also crucial for the functioning of the euro money market and , more generally , for other national and international financial markets ( such as foreign exchange , securities and derivatives markets ) .
The efficient clearing and settlement of securities transactions is also crucial to the orderly functioning of securities markets , the smooth conduct of monetary policy operations , and the stability of the financial system as a whole .
Its basic tasks will be to define and implement the monetary policy of the euro area , to hold and manage the official reserves of the participating Member States and conduct foreign exchange operations and to promote the smooth operation of payment systems in the euro area . The ESCB will also contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system .

As regards pled￭ ges ￭30 , the draft law applies , whatever the nature of the parties to the financial collateral arrangements , without restricting the categories of collateral tak￭ ers or providers ￭31 . The ECB notes in this respect that the Conseil d ￭' Etat ( the Council of State of Luxembourg ) , in a recent opinion ￭32 , suggests that , along the lines of the legislation adopted in Belgium ￭33 , there should not be any limitation in terms of personal scope on other types of financial collateral arrangements such as re￭ purchase agreements or transfers of title as collateral .
As regards financial collateral arrangements ( see paragraph 11 as regards net￭ ting arrangements ) , the draft law applies , as a rule , to all financial collateral arrangements without restricting the categories of collateral tak￭ ers or providers and , thus , also includes natural persons ( Article 4 ( 1 ) ￭) .
The ECB is in favour of the definition of  financial collateral arrangements  contained in Article 3 ( 1 ) ￭( a ) of the proposed Directive encomp￭ ass￭ ing both pledge structures and all transfer of title arrangements ( e ￭.￭ g ￭. re￭ purchase transactions or credit support arrangements ) , in order to contribute to the stability of the financial markets in the EU and to protect the collat￭ er￭ alisation techniques used by the Eurosystem .
In this context , any modification to existing national insolvency procedures should take into account the aims of the proposed Directive ( legal certainty , the efficiency of cross ￭-￭ border collateral transactions and the ease of collateral management ) as well as the interest of prudential supervis￭ ors in effective re￭ organisation measures and the stability of the financial system , the latter being of concern to the Eurosystem as evid￭ enced by Article 3 ￭.￭ 3 of the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB .
The ECB takes note that the proposed Directive covers both  financial instruments  as defined in Article 3 ( 1 ) ￭( h ) ( including transfer￭ able securities ) and cash . However , the ECB suggests that it be considered whether the scope of the proposed Directive could be extended to cover all types of assets that are eligible for Eurosystem credit operations , including inter alia credit claims in the form of bank loans .

First , the Eurosystem plays an active role in promoting co ￭-￭ operation among the national supervisory authorities , irrespective of the organisational model adopted in each country , as well as between those authorities and the Eurosystem , with a view to achieving a common understanding on relevant policy issues in prudential supervision and financial stability .

As at 31 December 2009 this item consisted mainly of a liability to the Federal Reserve amounting to Euros 4 ￭.￭ 5 billion ( 2008 : Euros 2￭ 19 ￭.￭ 7 billion ) in connection with the US dollar Ter￭ m Auc￭ tion Fac￭ ility . Under this programme , US dollars were provided by the Federal Reserve to the ECB by means of a temporary reciprocal currency arrangement ( swap line ) , with the aim of offering short ￭-￭ term US dollar funding to Eurosystem counterparties .

Annex 7 of this document re￭ produces a number of Treaty provisions relating to the changeover . 8 Pursuant to Article 109￭ l ( 4 ) , the Council of Ministers will , at the starting date of Stage Three , irre￭ voc￭ ably fix the conversion rates for the currencies of the Member States participating in the European currency area as well as the conversion rates at which the European currency will be substitu￭ ted for the national currencies , and the European currency will become a currency in its own right .
Portugal and Finland fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency on 1 January 1999 and will therefore participate in the euro area as from the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) . With a view to guiding the markets in the run ￭-￭ up to Stage Three , the ministers and central bank governors of the Member States of the European Union , the European Commission and the EMI announce the procedure for determining the irre￭ voc￭ able conversion rates for the euro .
The organisation of the changeover should be based on the following five principles , which are necessary to ensure transparency and public acceptance of the process : 1 ) there must be a clear legal framework for the introduction of the new European currency and its complete substitution for the national currencies in the Member States participating in the European currency area ;
If , following the above examination and procedures , the status of « Member States with a derogation » is abrog￭ ated , Article 109￭ l ( 5 ) of the Treaty provides for the fixing of the conversion rate at which the euro shall be substitu￭ ted for the currency of the Member State concerned , and for the adoption of all other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the euro in those Member States .
Article 109￭ l ( 4 ) goes on to state that the Council of Ministers will also take the other measures necessary for the rapid introduction of the European currency as the single currency of those Member States .

Article 12 - ￭- Additional information Article 12 ( a ) corresponds to Article 66 ( 2 ) of Directive 2001 ￭/￭ 34 / EC , Article 12 ( b ) and ( c ) to Article 81 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) whilst extending these disclosure requirements to sovereign debt issuers .

The relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term .
The single monetary policy has had , and will continue to have , an appropriate medium ￭-￭ term orientation , in line with the strategy I described a moment ago ￭. In this respect , monetary policy must always remain focused on the maintenance of price stability over the medium term .

European laws shall determine Eurojust '￭ s structure , work￭ ings , scope of action and tasks .



Within the operational framework for the implementation of monetary policy , which is based on a system of minimum reserve requirements , these instruments are used to manage liquidity conditions in the inter￭ bank money market with a view to ste￭ ering very short ￭-￭ term interest rates close to the ECB '￭ s key policy rate .
As well as ste￭ ering interest rates by managing liquidity , the central bank can also signal its monetary policy stance to the money market .
The purpose of these is to influence market interest rates , manage the liquidity situation in the banking system and signal the general direction of monetary policy .
The key functions of the minimum reserve system are to help stabilise money market interest rates and to en￭ large the structural liquidity shortage of the banking system , increasing the demand for central bank refinancing . 89
Within the operational framework for the implementation of monetary policy , open market operations and standing facilities are normally used to manage liquidity conditions in the inter￭ bank money market with a view to ste￭ ering very short ￭-￭ term interest rates close to the ECB '￭ s key policy rate .

Portugal and Finland fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency on 1 January 1999 and will therefore participate in the euro area as from the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) . With a view to guiding the markets in the run ￭-￭ up to Stage Three , the ministers and central bank governors of the Member States of the European Union , the European Commission and the EMI announce the procedure for determining the irre￭ voc￭ able conversion rates for the euro .
Of particular importance was the understanding , reached at the informal ECOFIN Council meeting in Mon￭ dorf ￭-￭ les￭ B￭ ains in September 1997 , that the bilateral exchange rates which will be used at the start of Stage Three in determining the irre￭ voc￭ able conversion rates for the euro would be pre ￭-￭ announced immediately after the selection of the countries which will adopt the single currency ( see Box 2 ) .
2 ￭.￭ 5 The pre ￭-￭ announcement of the bilateral rates to be used in determining the irre￭ voc￭ able conversion rates for the euro The Luxembourg European Council held in December 1997 stated in its conclusions that « the bilateral exchange rates which will be used to determine the conversion rates for the euro will be announced on 3 May 1998 for those Member States participating in the euro from the start » .
On 1 January 1999 Stage Three , the final stage of EMU , started with the irre￭ voc￭ able fixing of the conversion rates of the currencies of the 11 Member States initially participating , and with the introduction of the euro as the single currency .
However , it was possible to pre ￭-￭ announce the bilateral rates of the currencies participating in the euro area which will be used on 31 December 1998 to set the irre￭ voc￭ able conversion rates for the euro . The Joint Comm￭ uni￭ qué ￭6 issued on 2 May 1998 by the Ministers and central bank governors of the EU Member States participating in the euro area , the European Commission and the EMI , as the for￭ er￭ un￭ ner 6

The deficit ratio moved from 7 ￭.￭ 9 ￭% of GDP in 1997 to 2 ￭.￭ 6 ￭% in 2006 , after having reached very high levels of around 10 % in 1998 and 2003 .

The solution proposed was to introduce a temporary option for Member States suffering from severe cash ￭-￭ flow difficulties to request a 100 ￭% reimbursement for financing labour market measures under the European Social Fund ￭, that is to say ￭, derogation from the principle of cofinancing ￭.







I believe this is the right approach ￭.

These are two extremely important issues ￭.
These two issues are crucial ￭.
But although these issues are important ￭, I believe that they are not the most important ￭.

It is estimated that 43 million EU citizens are at risk of malnutrition - that is a shocking figure ￭.











These people should be brought to justice ￭.
Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice ￭.
Those responsible must ￭, eventually ￭, be brought to justice ￭.
Secondly ￭, it must bring the perpetrators to justice ￭.


The EU ￭' s agricultural policy ￭, in the form of export and production subsidies ￭, should therefore be w￭ ound down and ￭, to a certain extent ￭, replaced by subsidies for bio ￭-￭ diversity and environmental measures ￭.










Europe deserves better ￭.
Europe deserves better ￭.





This is certainly not what people want ￭.
That is what the citizens of Europe expect ￭.
































The same applies to Croatia ￭.
The same applies to Turkey ￭.







. Mr President ￭, there is none so dea￭ f as he who will not hear ￭.






That is another problem which needs to be resolved ￭.
This is a problem that needs to be resolved ￭.
This is an important matter that needs to be addressed urgently ￭.


I believe that the proposal to extend the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency (￭ E￭ ASA ￭) with the aim of establishing common rules on civil aviation to be applied by all airlines operating in Europe ￭, whether or not they are based in the European Union ￭, is a step forward ￭.
President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council ￭. (￭ FI ￭) Madam President ￭, Regulation (￭ EC ￭) No 23￭ 20 ￭/￭ 2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security represents the Community ￭'￭ s current legal framework in the area of civil aviation security ￭.

It should be noted that the right to good administration is a fundamental right for European citizens ￭, enshrined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ￭.
I feel that the adoption of this decision will fill a significant gap in the system protecting the European citizens ￭' fundamental right to the protection of personal data ￭, which is now enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ￭.
One of the concrete achievements is the birth of the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself ￭, and although the Charter is far from complete ￭, nevertheless adding legal force to it - let us say by subscri￭ bing to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights - would represent a much ￭-￭ needed step forward in the Community ￭'￭ s defence of fundamental rights ￭.
Article 34 in Chapter IV of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ￭, entitled Solidarity ￭, lays down clearly the right to protection in a range of cases ￭.

& k￭ chart ￭; is a & k￭ office ￭; component and is very well integrated with & k￭ spread ￭; to allow visu￭ alization of sp￭ read￭ sheet data ￭. But it is also possible to use & k￭ chart ￭; as a stand￭ alone application or integrate it in other & k￭ office ￭; components ￭.
As soon as you have created a chart in & k￭ spread ￭; you can take full advantage of all the & k￭ chart ￭; features by double clicking on the chart area ￭. This is necessary to get to all advanced configuration options ￭. Keep in mind that the data editor is not available when & k￭ chart ￭; is embedded into & k￭ spread ￭; ￭. This is obvious since & k￭ spread ￭; serves ￭, from & k￭ chart ￭; '￭ s point of view ￭, as a powerful data provider ￭.
But embed￭ ding is not limited to & k￭ spread ￭; ￭. A & k￭ chart ￭; chart can be embedded in many of the & k￭ office ￭; components like & k￭ word ￭; ￭, & k￭ pres￭ enter ￭; or & ki￭ vio ￭; ￭.

It wasn ￭’￭ t always so ￭.




The continent ￭’￭ s trade with the EU is already massive ￭: together ￭, African countries represent the EU ￭’￭ s third ￭-￭ largest trading partner ￭, after the United States and China ￭, accounting for nearly 7 ￭% of total extra ￭-￭ EU trade in goods ￭, including 7 ￭% of imports and 8 ￭% of exports ￭.
Before 1949 ￭, India absorbed roughly 60 ￭% of Pakistan ￭’￭ s exports and accounted for 70 ￭% of its imports ￭.



We are not calling for abolishing everything and starting from scr￭ atch ￭.




Turkey now finds itself ￭, through its alliance with Iran and support for Hamas ￭, rus￭ hing head￭ long into a series of conflicts – with Europe ￭, the US ￭, Israel ￭, and moderate Arab regimes that have survived Iranian Shia fundamentalism but may now feel threatened by a neo ￭-￭ Ottoman Sunni foreign policy ￭.
Nonetheless ￭, it argues that a victory in Syria by a coalition of Russia ￭, Iran ￭, Hezbollah ￭, and Assad ￭’￭ s regime would pose an even greater danger ￭.



















At the start of the third millennium ￭, Ban ￭’￭ s predecessor ￭, Kofi Annan ￭, brought the world ￭’￭ s leaders together to adopt the Millennium Development Goals ￭, which established ambitious targets to be achieved in the fight against poverty ￭, hunger ￭, and disease by 2015 ￭.
The United Nations General Assembly will adopt the Sustainable Development Goals ￭, an ambitious set of global objectives expected to improve the lives of millions of people by 2030 ￭.

True ￭, citizens of the West will have cheaper goods ￭, but being able to purchase gro￭ cer￭ ies 20 ￭% cheaper at W￭ al ￭-￭ Mar￭ t does not necessarily make up for wage losses ￭.

RO￭ ME – Following the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals ￭, which guided global development efforts in the years 2000 ￭-￭ 2015 ￭, the world ￭’￭ s governments are currently negotiating a set of Sustainable Development Goals (￭ S￭ DGs ￭) for the period 2016 ￭-￭ 2030 ￭.
PAR￭ IS – It is now hal￭ f￭ way to the target date of 2015 for the Millennium Development Goals (￭ M￭ DGs ￭) – the ambitious blu￭ e￭ print ￭, backed by the entire development community ￭, for development in the world ￭’￭ s poorest countries ￭.
During the 15 years of the Millennium Development Goals (￭ M￭ DGs ￭) ￭, the predecessor to the Sustainable Development Goals (￭ S￭ DGs ￭) ￭, the percentage of people living in poverty – defined as less than $￭ 1 ￭.￭ 90 a day – declined significantly ￭, from nearly 27 ￭% in 2000 ￭, when the M￭ DGs began ￭, to about 9 ￭% in 2017 ￭.
According to the recently published United Nations ￭’ 2012 Millennium Development Report ￭, achieving the Millennium Development Goals (￭ M￭ DGs ￭) – the global agenda set in 2000 to improve the living standards of the world ￭’￭ s poorest by 2015 – will be a challenge ￭, but is within reach ￭.
WASHINGTON ￭, DC – The question of how the world can end extreme poverty and improve human well￭ being will take on new urgency in 2015 ￭, as the Millennium Development Goals (￭ M￭ DGs ￭) expire and a new set of goals – the proposed Sustainable Development Goals (￭ S￭ DGs ￭) – are fin￭ alized ￭.


















































The US government is now trying to re￭ pay old debt by borrowing more ￭; in 2010 ￭, average annual debt creation (￭ including debt re￭ finance ￭) moved above $￭ 4 trillion ￭, or almost one ￭-￭ quarter of GDP ￭, compared to the pre ￭-￭ crisis average of 8 ￭.￭ 7 ￭% of GDP ￭.
Indeed ￭, according to the International Monetary Fund ￭, Chinese corporate ￭, government ￭, and household debt has increased by about $￭ 23 trillion in the last decade alone ￭, and its debt ￭-￭ to ￭-￭ GDP ratio has risen by around 100 percentage points ￭, to more than 250 ￭% ￭.

The fact that people want to come to the US ￭, together with immigrants ￭’ upward mobility ￭, enh￭ ances the country ￭’￭ s appeal ￭.







In 1998 ￭, Chinese ￭- and Indian ￭-￭ born engineers were running one ￭-￭ quarter of Si￭ licon Valley ￭’￭ s high ￭-￭ technology businesses ￭, which accounted for $￭ 17 ￭.￭ 8 billion in sales ￭, and in 2005 ￭, foreign ￭-￭ born immigrants had helped start one in four American technology start ￭-￭ ups over the previous decade ￭.















Of the people who stopped when there were six ￭, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j￭ ar of j￭ am ￭.
































Gi￭ ve me predic￭ tability ￭, give me surprise ￭.






Let ￭'￭ s start with technology ￭.





















They feed on other little things ￭. They feed on mos￭ quit￭ o lar￭ v￭ ae ￭.















Of course they would ￭.














What do I mean by that ￭?
And what do I mean by that ￭?
These are actually solutions ￭. And what do I mean by that ￭?
Now ￭, what do I mean by well motivated ￭?
What does that mean ￭?





But actually ￭, it ￭'￭ s not ￭. It ￭'￭ s actually a wonderful thing ￭.
But it ￭'￭ s not ￭.




What have we learned ￭?
So what have we learned from all this ￭?
What can we learn from them ￭?
So what have we learned ￭?
So ￭, what have we learned ￭?




It ￭'￭ s also understanding ￭.
It ￭'￭ s information ￭.





















But it ￭'￭ s not really that easy ￭, that it ￭'￭ s all a good story ￭.
That ￭'￭ s not too good ￭.
And then it ￭'￭ s never good enough ￭.
But it ￭'￭ s not that simple ￭.

But that ￭'￭ s not really the whole story ￭.



























So what I ￭'￭ m going to do is I ￭'￭ m going to show you two patterns of dec￭ eption ￭.
And what I ￭'￭ m going to do is ￭, I ￭'￭ m going to hold it here ￭, and I ￭'￭ m going to spin it ￭. And for all of you ￭, you ￭'￭ ll see it probably sp￭ inning this direction ￭.
I ￭'￭ m going in ￭, I ￭'￭ m going to figure this stuff out ￭, I ￭'￭ m going to spend a year ￭, I ￭'￭ m going to totally de￭ construct shame ￭, I ￭'￭ m going to understand how vulnerability works ￭, and I ￭'￭ m going to out￭ smart it ￭.
Here ￭'￭ s what I ￭'￭ m going to do ￭: I ￭'￭ m going to put objects on the screen ￭.
And here I ￭'￭ m expecting at any moment ￭, "￭ OK ￭, they ￭'￭ re going to turn the page ￭, and I ￭'￭ m going to see the cars ￭, I ￭'￭ m going to see the sk￭ et￭ ches ￭, I ￭'￭ m going to see maybe some idea of where it ￭'￭ s going ￭. ￭"

And then I do it ￭.

And there you are ￭.
So there they are ￭.
There you are ￭, OK ￭.

Very interesting ￭.

















And we ￭'￭ re going to do it ￭.







L￭ G ￭: Ten of diam￭ onds ￭, y￭ e￭ ah ￭.




So come on ￭! There we go ￭, there we go ￭. Thank you ￭. Thank you ￭. Oh ￭.
There you go ￭.
There you go ￭.
So ￭, here you go ￭.
So ￭. Thank you very much ￭.













And that doesn ￭'￭ t seem right ￭.

It ￭'￭ s never been done ￭.





















And what I ￭'￭ m going to do is to show you pretty much what ￭'￭ s here ￭.



















But there ￭'￭ s a problem ￭.
There ￭'￭ s another problem ￭.




And when that doesn ￭'￭ t work ￭, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart ￭, then we move on to a third assumption ￭: they know the truth ￭, and they are deliberately distor￭ ting it for their own mal￭ evol￭ ent purposes ￭.












We didn ￭'￭ t really understand that ￭.

But they can ￭'￭ t ￭.
Because you can ￭'￭ t ￭.
And you can ￭'￭ t tell ￭.
These kids have attitudes that you just can ￭'￭ t believe ￭.
We can ￭'￭ t ￭.



















So ￭, embry￭ onic stem cells are really incredible cells ￭.
But adult stem cells are not embry￭ onic stem cells ￭.
But the moral controversy surrounding embry￭ onic stem cells - ￭- the fact that these cells are derived from five ￭-￭ day old human embryos - ￭- has encouraged research into other types of stem cells ￭.
You all know about embry￭ onic stem cells ￭.



It wasn ￭'￭ t that ￭.
But it wasn ￭'￭ t that simple ￭.
