If you agree ￭, Parliament ￭, the Commission and the Council must work ￭, by consensus ￭, between now and the Council of Ministers on 20 and 21 December ￭. I have indeed heard this suggestion made by several rapporteurs ￭.

The Koso￭ var police are delighted with the excellent cooperation they are enjoy￭ ing with EU￭ LE￭ X ￭.
For me ￭, the cru￭ x of the matter is paragraph 40 ￭, which ￭, in the form that it was adopted today ￭, together with other components of the Stockholm Programme ￭, will provo￭ ke conflicts of jurisdiction ￭.
However ￭, there are a number of other amendments which I cannot accept ￭, either for technical reasons or because their detailed nature runs counter to the purpose of the Framework Directive ￭.
Spain ￭’￭ s transition to democracy is inex￭ tric￭ ably linked to our entry into the European Union twenty years ago ￭.
I would point out that the Maastricht Treaty does not give any particular powers to the European Union to organise the port system and the rules for managing sea ports ￭.

Of course towns must be accessible to the fire service ￭, the police ￭, amb￭ ul￭ ances ￭, removal v￭ ans and the vehicles of persons with limited mobility ￭, but scar￭ ce open spaces must be kept primarily for use by pe￭ des￭ tri￭ ans ￭, cycl￭ ists ￭, tr￭ ams ￭, children ￭'￭ s play￭ grounds and parks and gar￭ dens ￭.

That means we need very clear definitions on how to reform copyright ￭, and we therefore need the work done by the Commission on which sort of European fair use we want and clear definitions on what are orph￭ an works ￭.
As Mr Sta￭ es mentioned ￭, on 26 May 2005 the Ad￭ voc￭ ate ￭-￭ General delivered conclusions that are very favourable to the Commission ￭’￭ s position ￭, as Mr Rui￭ z ￭-￭ J￭ arab￭ o Col￭ om￭ er suggests that the Court annu￭ l the relevant provisions of the framework decision of 27 January 2003 ￭.

Despite the progress in the regulation of the sector and the improvements brought about by the introduction of the euro ￭, the integration of the Community financial services markets and the promotion of competition in the sector do not appear to have achieved their full potential ￭.
Rather than face reality ￭, I fear that we will again face a Brussels conspir￭ acy to circum￭ vent the people ￭.
However ￭, we think that there should be a greater focus on special problems in the regions ￭, which could be accommod￭ ated more effectively via the cofinancing rates ￭.
The regulation proposes that both systems be available in each country ￭.
However ￭, due to bureaucratic formalities ￭, this system did not bring about any results ￭, hence the need for the additional protocol of 18 December 1997 ￭, which did not require the sentenced person ￭'￭ s consent ￭.
However ￭, as you are aware ￭, there is a proposal to amend this directive ￭.
It is not just about the number of chick￭ ens per square me￭ tre ￭; it is also about the atmosph￭ eric conditions in the houses and whether there is str￭ aw or anything in them ￭, so that the chick￭ ens have slightly better conditions during their very short lives ￭.
That is why the Commission proposal cannot constitute a basis for discussion ￭, because it does not address the problem of wine ￭-￭ growing ￭.
For example ￭, in my country ￭, Portugal ￭, this limit is twelve years ￭, and can be increased by one ￭-￭ third ￭.
Consequently ￭, eight years after the crime was committed ￭, the sentenced person has not yet been extr￭ ad￭ ited and the execution of the sentence has not yet started ￭.

Regarding negative effects ￭, it is most important that we should distinguish between things on the Internet which are undesirable and those which are illegal ￭. As far as things which are illegal and harmful go ￭, the Internet brings nothing new compared with existing printed media ￭.

Firstly ￭, the Commission has proposed communi￭ tis￭ ing - i ￭.￭ e ￭. introducing by means of qualified majority voting in the Council without ratification by the national parliaments - international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property ￭, a possibility indeed already opened by Article 132 ￭(￭ 5 ￭) of the Treaty of Amsterdam ￭.
E￭ specially since these consult￭ ants to the industry are prepared to allow the introduction of ingredients not only to increase consumption but also to increase habitu￭ ation ￭.
This technique has been used for many years ￭.
This technique has been used for many years ￭.
. Mr President ￭, Mr President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council ￭, Commissioner ￭, ladies and gentlemen ￭, the additional protocol ￭, like so many other issues around the beginning of negotiations with Turkey ￭, raises what is very much a point of principle ￭, that being the question of whether a candidate for accession is willing to accept all the parts of that entity of which it des￭ ires to become a member ￭, or ￭, to put it another way ￭, whether it recognises all the Member States ￭.
We cannot accuse the Council of Europe and the OSCE High Commissioner of belonging to a particular political family ￭.
However ￭, negotiations on a new protocol initially broke down ￭, which is why we agreed with Equ￭ atorial Guinea that the old protocol should be extended by a year ￭.
There are known cases of duty being applied to vehicles purchased by Polish citizens in EU countries ￭, despite rul￭ ings by the Court of Justice ￭, and of delays in re￭ funding wrong￭ ly calculated charges that have been paid ￭.
The purpose of science is not to conduct a mam￭ mo￭ th project up￭ stream of the reform and then operate reform management ￭; the purpose of science is to accompany fisheries policy ￭.
They will only authorise some specific agreed bodies for the re￭ assessment activities ￭.
Although I very much welcome the Commission ￭'￭ s proposal and appreciate the demanding nature of this work ￭, I am disappointed by the fact that this document has totally om￭ itted the remaining countries ￭, without even giving them a timetable of any kind ￭.
It seems amazing to me that anyone would wish to deny people their basic rights at EU level just because of their age ￭, disability ￭, religion or belief or sexual orientation ￭.
The illegal action of a major state such as the United States of America on an independent continent such as Europe and the violation of human rights are an insul￭ t to Europe ￭, which gave birth to democracy and secured freedom ￭, the pre￭ sumption of innoc￭ ence and security three centuries ago with the declaration of human rights ￭.
Commissioner ￭, I too am very disappointed by the somewhat ti￭ mid position adopted by the Commission and by the statements it has made ￭, especially in reply to the questions asked by other Members ￭.
Mr President ￭, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment on this year ￭' s budget ￭, I want to acknowledge the difficult framework in which it has been constructed and the serious pressures upon all of us ￭.
They are not the only problems ￭.
They are not the only problems ￭.
Secondly ￭, I am pleased that Belgium has been comm￭ ended for the quality of the cooperation between its social partners in the preparation of this matter ￭.
The interest in wi￭ ping out poverty is hypo￭ critical ￭.
Therefore ￭, I would like to remind everyone once again about the original intention ￭, because our current discussions about the External Action Service ￭, the High Representative and the Vice ￭-￭ President of the Commission represent one result of the Constitutional Convention ￭, which was taken over by the intergovernmental conference for the Treaty of Lisbon ￭.
In view of the ing￭ l￭ ori￭ ous history of the European Police College ￭'￭ s financial conduct ￭, it is essential that a detailed review is carried out ￭.
I sincerely hope that Members of this Parliament will have the chance to act as observers ￭, as these elections must be seen to have been free ￭, fair and transparent in the atmosphere of fear that President Mugabe has created ￭.
Let us hope that it will express its view soon ￭.
Let us hope that it will express its view soon ￭.
A few days ago ￭, the Commission said it was its own objective to be able to welcome ten new Member States by the year 2005 ￭.
In other areas ￭, there is a less obvious basis in the treaties ￭, or else there is really no basis ￭.
There is a real opportunity between now and the presidential elections in Northern Cyprus in April which should be seized ￭, and this is a matter for all sides ￭.
In response ￭, they told me that they felt completely reas￭ su￭ red ￭.
As the President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council - and you ￭, too ￭, Vice ￭-￭ President - mentioned ￭, it is intr￭ insi￭ cally better ￭, on environmental and economic grounds ￭, to avoid un￭ lad￭ en jour￭ neys in Europe ￭.
There ￭, cooperation between three or four countries in respect of the upper layer of the airspace is already in place ￭.
I also welcome the Commission ￭'￭ s proposal to apply the '￭ de minimis ￭' rules to all arrangements between SMEs and call on the candidate countries to implement the competition rules quickly so that there are no distortions of competition between different industrial locations ￭.
The term has not kept up with life expec￭ tancy ￭, meaning that musicians lose the benefit for their work just as they retire and most need the income ￭.
One of the measures put forward in the Commission ￭'￭ s proposal was a derogation from the principle of cofinancing by introducing a temporary option for Member States suffering from cash ￭-￭ flow problems to request a 100 ￭% reimbursement for financing measures eligible under the European Social Fund ￭.

This situation seems to me all the more serious since while French law expressly stipulates that a ruling from the Council of State concerning a Member of the European Parliament must be given in plenary session ￭, it was only pronounced in this case by two sub ￭-￭ sections ￭, which constitutes a serious breach of Mr Le Pen ￭' s rights ￭.
. A key element in the running of a representative democratic institution is compliance with the principles governing – appropriately – the rules of parliamentary immunity ￭.
Today over 50 ￭% of the population are saying ￭: yes ￭, we need authoritarian governments to solve our problems ￭.
It should draw its credibility from two sources - not only the Council but also the European Parliament - and so far ￭, we are not fully satisfied ￭.
But this ￭, too ￭, must add a new urgency for the Council and the Commission in respect of an EU ￭-￭ led political initiative to resolve the Cyprus problem under the a￭ eg￭ is of the United Nations l￭ est ￭, again ￭, we should institu￭ tion￭ alise inside the Union an intr￭ act￭ able and difficult problem on that divided island ￭.
Hear￭ ing the President ￭-￭ in ￭-￭ Office of the Council today ￭, I realised that stagnation and paraly￭ sis have taken hold here ￭.
I believe that is the right approach ￭.

I would also highlight what I consider to be the most important new development this year ￭, namely the legal basis for the second generation of the Schengen Information System ￭.
Moreover ￭, what is particularly painful in the current context is the fact that ￭, in spite of the considerable damage recorded having been taken on board ￭, there is a desire to continue in the wrong direction ￭, no matter what the cost ￭.
First that social protection is a key element of the European social model and a vital factor in maintaining social cohesion and solidarity ￭.
It left yesterday ￭.
Indeed ￭, it will help in our very own action plan to face head ￭-￭ on the issue of terrorism within our own borders ￭.
We need well ￭-￭ qualified people ￭.
We need well ￭-￭ qualified people ￭.
However ￭, the exact causes of the accident are still unknown and the three investigations under way by A￭ to￭ fin￭ a ￭, the Ministry of the Environment and the At￭ tor￭ ney ￭-￭ General might take a long time ￭.
Indeed ￭, this is a factor of great concern which promp￭ ts me to ask for the European Union to pay the greatest possible attention to all three of these countries ￭.
Fortunately ￭, there are some voices in the EU who are honest and say that we have the substance of the Constitution and all we have done is to change the termin￭ ology ￭.
It will not ￭, however ￭, be a day of great rejo￭ icing ￭.
For if we cannot work out a clear position at first reading stage ￭, the Council then has the last word ￭.
The Polish tw￭ ins helped you by mentioning the war ￭.
It will go from item one over the next two or three weeks to item three ￭, and then it will be gone ￭.
What sort of example are we setting for the countries which we are in￭ vi￭ ting in and which we are even trying to help before their accession ￭, when the European Union does not abide by its own basic policies and statutory obligations ￭?
Madam President ￭, I was happy to hear that the Commissioner is determined to maintain food standards in the EU ￭, but there are two issues that I want to pull her up on ￭.
(￭ RO ￭) The Arctic region ￭, just like Antarc￭ tica ￭, is particularly vulnerable to climate change ￭.
So I can assure you that your fears are un￭ founded ￭.
Speci￭ fically on the subject of prisons ￭, but not those for terrorists ￭, I would like to point out the truly in￭ humane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya ￭, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death ￭.
We need a suitable ￭, integrated policy ￭, which will help to preserve and rebuild our water reserves ￭.
We would like to stress the need for funds for the future and long ￭-￭ term continuous training in companies ￭, instead of individual share￭ holdings ￭.
We need to set an example to the Member States by reducing our foot￭ print by 50 ￭% ￭.
We have now been discussing the collapse of the system for months ￭, as Mr Schulz has said ￭, without ensuring that the new regulations are mandatory ￭.
We have had enormous problems with outstanding commitments that have accumulated in our general external aid ￭.
With that specific purpose in mind ￭, my services are currently working on a report on the current state aid practices of Member States based on the answers they have given to a Commission questionnaire ￭.
Here is what Mrs V￭ ay￭ ss￭ ade wrote in a letter dated 8 March 1985 ￭. She said that she would like to point out straight away that ￭, pursuant to Rule 5 ￭(￭ 1 ￭) of the Rules of Procedure ￭, a request for the waiver of immunity can only be referred once it has been established that the request is from the appropriate authority ￭.
Now I hear some Members of this House who believe that only the state can provide these services and it should be on a monopoly basis ￭.
Today ￭, when this House is being asked to give its opinion on the outcome of a conciliation procedure that will bring a conclusion to this long process - more than three years ￭' work - we as rapporteurs are delighted with this joint approach ￭, which has enabled us to achieve what I believe to be a very satisfactory result ￭.
They have sun￭ k almost without trace in this communiqué ￭.
As it is clear that we have been elected to this House by the citizens of Europe to protect their interests ￭, it is with this conviction that we also found compromises to accommodate some of the amendments tabled by the other political groups ￭.
This is a document which ￭, if properly prepared based on a comprehensive ￭, systematic approach ￭, could act as a mechanism for monitoring and stream￭ lining the evolution of EU law ￭.
We have turned a blind eye to what has gone on in Albania for too long and we are now re￭ ap￭ ing the consequences ￭.

Some fishing vessels were fired on a few days ago ￭.
In the debate on this question ￭, Parliament ￭'￭ s position is that we should not set a date for the prolongation of the directives ￭, because as soon as we set a date we are adopting and announc￭ ing unilateral policies ￭.
We have abstained on those two issues ￭.
Nobody knows the date they will join ￭, but we must not today give the impression that the door to accession is closed ￭.
In the Council ￭, we have clarified the scope and have strengthened the authorisation provisions to provide a greater drive towards substitution ￭.

I begin by offering my warm￭ est thanks to Mrs Ag￭ li￭ etta ￭, the rapporteur ￭, who has done an excellent job in clari￭ fying the so ￭-￭ called comitology issue which ￭, in terms of the procedures of the European Union really is ro￭ cket science ￭.
I understand that some solutions have been put forward in this regard ￭.
I think that the Commission ￭'￭ s position on this is also very clear ￭: even though the primary responsibility for the euro currency remains with the eurozone Member States ￭, it is very clear that any future cooperation mechanism must be open to others and that all the work we are doing to increase competitiveness and convergence must be for all 27 Member States ￭.
The Commission regrets the acts of violence which occurred in the city of Buenos Aires ￭.
Madam President ￭, I do not want to pro￭ long the discussion ￭, but an explanation of vote means ￭, I am explaining why I voted in such and such a way ￭.

That we should hear this from the mouth of the President of the Commission is for us a cause for satisfaction ￭, at least for the moment ￭.

In reply to Mr Kh￭ an￭ b￭ hai ￭'￭ s remarks that not one euro has been given here ￭, let me say that every day we are pu￭ mp￭ ing money into the fight against AIDS ￭, malaria ￭, tuberculosis ￭.

It is not the interests of foreign immigrants ￭, including those of our fellow human beings in distress ￭, that we primarily have in mind ￭.
All that we want to do today is to remind you that this request is not about protectionism ￭; it is not industries that are no longer able to compete on the international market that we want to defend ￭, but consumers ￭: we want to draw attention to the theme of health ￭, the environment and genuine reciprocity on the world market ￭, which is lacking today ￭.
He informed us that economic and monetary union will mean a two ￭-￭ speed Europe and ￭, moreover ￭, that the strong countries are wonder￭ ing whether a number of the weaker countries will be suitable for that two ￭-￭ speed Europe ￭.

Public opinion polls indicate that 70 ￭% of European citizens come into daily contact with sport in some form ￭.
In other countries ￭, no reference is made to sexual harassment ￭, or it is only included in a general definition of harassment (￭ in Poland ￭, sexual harassment is defined in Section 6 ￭, Article 183￭ a of the Labour Code ￭) ￭, which makes it much more difficult for injured parties to pursue their rights ￭.
The 8 ￭+￭ 2 ￭+￭ 1 formula should be supported ￭, as that is what we need today ￭: a win ￭-￭ win approach ￭, I would say ￭, which will promote research ￭, which is crucial for Europe ￭, and provide better patient access to less expensive medicines ￭, with the impact that we know this will have on our governments ￭’ health budgets ￭.
We ￭, therefore ￭, obviously welcome the fact that action is now being taken ￭.
Our partners have accepted this principle in return for a guarantee that wisdom and common sense will prevail when it comes to selecting the issues for discussion ￭.

That shows why the family ￭, as has been said ￭, is the key place where we must promote the rights of the child ￭.
So the EU has shown that it can be a key influence on national policy towards the death penalty ￭, and we should not be afraid to use that influence ￭.
Patients travelling to another EU country for treatment must know whether they will be reimbur￭ sed and have all the necessary information on the type and quality of healthcare in the host country ￭.
Finally ￭, I would like to say that the South Korean side was very positive towards the results of the meeting ￭, particularly the assurances concerning a second summit and missile defence ￭.

I would not ￭, though ￭, want the report ￭'￭ s call for a master plan for enhanced airport capacity to be mis￭ understood as Brussels mus￭ cl￭ ing in and telling national ￭, regional and local authorities where to build new airports ￭; obviously ￭, it just means po￭ oling information and objectives ￭.

In addition ￭, the Council has given an interpretation of the inspection percentage (￭ 20 ￭% ￭) of the number of attest￭ ations issued ￭.
In mid ￭-￭ 1990 ￭, France and Germany considered imposing trade restrictions on British beef ￭, but Commissioner Mac￭ Sh￭ arry threatened to take them to the Court of Justice ￭.
If that were the case ￭, we would be very supportive ￭.
The use of personal data is beneficial to public safety ￭.
Mr President ￭, there are obviously many good reasons to ask financial institutions to contribute more to tax revenues post financial crisis ￭, and it is a shame that this resolution only looks at transaction taxes and not at examples like the Obama levy ￭.
I believe ￭, Commissioner ￭, that we still have some persu￭ ading to do together ￭.
I believe ￭, Commissioner ￭, that we still have some persu￭ ading to do together ￭.
Right now ￭, we in Spain have examples of sectors of the economy with good future prospects ￭, such as telecommunications ￭.
Only then will public opinion be persuaded that the European Council remains true to its fundamental mandate and is determining Union strategy and policy ￭, rather than having to spend time and energy worrying about duty ￭-￭ free shopping ￭.
Member of the Commission ￭. - Mr President ￭, first of all I would like to thank Mr Cad￭ ec and the EP Committees that have sponsored this own ￭-￭ initiative report ￭.

I think that this is the most important test for the European Union ￭, the b￭ oldest political project over the last few hundred years ￭.
It is not just a question of passi￭ v￭ ity and s￭ ins of omission ￭.
I can assure the Member that the Council attaches great importance to these matters and that we will continue to monitor developments extremely closely ￭.
It should be possible to opt for solutions that are best suited to various conditions and to each operating environment ￭.
Due to the risky nature of direct foreign investments ￭, a high level of legal certainty must be guaranteed during the transition period ￭.
Furthermore ￭, it should be noted that exemptions for energy ￭-￭ intensive industries could put the enterprises against whom they are competing ￭, but which do not use energy ￭-￭ intensive methods to produce their products or materials ￭, at a competitive disadvantage ￭.
Once again ￭, this document is based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights ￭, although the rapporteur has chosen a subject ￭-￭ based overview of the Charter ￭, analysing the crimin￭ alisation of vulnerable social movements and groups ￭.
The effects are de￭ dram￭ ati￭ zed and minim￭ ized ￭.
Of course ￭, we can express indignation over what has happened in the past ￭, but today ￭, it is clear that we must move forward ￭.
I would like to conclude by remin￭ ding you that the right to effective legal protection is a fundamental right enshrined in European constitutions and ￭, specifically ￭, in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ￭.

We got the worst of all wor￭ lds ￭, in that the Union owned the fish ￭, but the national governments had the job of poli￭ cing them ￭.
But at the same time we need a sense of common purpose ￭.
We also consider the procedure undertaken by the Commission to be very serious ￭, procedure that involves the European Parliament directly ￭.
Fourthly ￭, I would also like to express my particular gratitude to Mrs Ce￭ der￭ schi￭ ö￭ ld ￭, Mr Orlando and Mr Bon￭ temp￭ i ￭, for successfully compil￭ ing our work within a ti￭ mes￭ c￭ ale which allows the Council to make use of it in due course ￭.

Otherwise we would have not had Eurodac by the beginning of next year but the next debates would have been held some￭ time during next year and Eurodac would maybe have come a year later ￭.
Subject ￭: Crisis management Can the Council clarify one aspect of the EU ￭'￭ s new defence policy which has not been made plain in the debate in Sweden ￭: will military intervention by the EU ￭'￭ s planned rapid reaction force always require a United Nations mandate ￭?
A further consideration is the Commission ￭'￭ s commitment to better regulation ￭.
The costly investment involved ￭, which is almost entirely to be borne priv￭ ately ￭, readily becomes concentrated in dens￭ ely populated areas and ￭, even there ￭, among the affluent ￭.

At the same time ￭, the national independence of the Member States will be respected in that the country of origin principle does not form the basis of the directive ￭.
That is why I agree with the conclusion reached by the committee ￭.
And what proposal is being made for dealing with this crisis ￭?
Mr President ￭, colleagues ￭, two years ago the European Parliament rejected at the third reading the initial draft directive on the legal protection of bio￭ technological inventions ￭.
On behalf of the Group of the European People ￭'￭ s Party ￭, I should like to clarify our position as a group ￭.

On behalf of the Group of the European People ￭'￭ s Party ￭, I should like to clarify our position as a group ￭.
Our rules state ￭, however ￭, that unless the Council decides unanimously ￭, the Commission proposal cannot be legally modified ￭.
Moreover ￭, such growth does not come about of its own accord ￭.
The harm done to the principle of subsidiarity by the requirement for organic separation between the regul￭ ator and the operator prevents Member States from organising their national air traffic control systems in the way that they would wish ￭, possibly within the second pillar of the CFSP with ￭, as its cor￭ oll￭ ary ￭, harmonisation with NATO ￭.
